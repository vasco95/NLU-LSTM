  my dear miss woodhouse -- i come quite over - powered .  <eos>   ah !  <eos>   so i got sophy to lend me a hand , and we soon shifted their quarters ; and now i am quite snug , with my little shaving glass in one corner , and another great thing that i never go near ."  <eos>   " he will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drop ' s one ' s scissors , or anything that happens .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   " but really , i am half ashamed , and wish i had never taken up the idea ."  <eos>   in a moment he went on --  <eos>   mr . elton is good - humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle .  <eos>   anne found a nice seat for her , on a dry sunny bank , under the hedge - row , in which she had no doubt of their still being , in some spot or other .  <eos>   " upon my word , emma ."  <eos>   the time now approached for lady russell ' s return : the day was even fixed ; and anne , being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled , was looking forward to an early removal to kellynch , and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it .  <eos>   she could only offer one solution ; it was , perhaps , for elizabeth ' s sake .  <eos>   it was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could emma procure as to what he truly was .  <eos>   not unfrequently , through emma ' s persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card - table for him .  <eos>   " yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and colonel and mrs . campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately ."  <eos>   but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father !  <eos>   " to be sure we do ," cried his father ; " mrs . bates -- we passed her house -- i saw miss bates at the window .  <eos>   what !  <eos>   she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself , by representing that though he certainly would make them nine , yet he always said so little , that the increase of noise would be very immaterial .  <eos>   but about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr . perry ; i happened to meet him in the street .  <eos>   he sat musing a little while , and then said ,  <eos>   her own behaviour had been so very improper !  <eos>   our part of london is very superior to most others !-- you must not confound us with london in general , my dear sir .  <eos>   i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .  <eos>   i do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing !"  <eos>   mrs . weston ' s partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me .  <eos>   " pray do .  <eos>   he could sing a little himself .  <eos>   " it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if mr . and mrs . weston do not .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse ' s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill - bestowed .  <eos>   " it is very pretty ," said mr . woodhouse .  <eos>   the good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me .  <eos>   they vindicated him against the base aspersion .  <eos>   perhaps to hartfield , perhaps to the abbey mill , perhaps into his woods .-- miss woodhouse , this is not like our friend knightley !-- can you explain it ?"  <eos>   what a letter the man writes !"  <eos>   nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind ;-- and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her !-- it certainly was very extraordinary !-- and knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more .  <eos>   " my mother ' s deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all .  <eos>   -- repeated mr .  <eos>   " well ," said mrs . weston , laughing , " perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give jane such a respectable home ."  <eos>   she spoke with great agitation ; and emma very feelingly replied , " that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now .  <eos>   a large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabella ' s marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection .  <eos>   not to wait upon a bride is very remiss .  <eos>   these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick .  <eos>   with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever .  <eos>   as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them no service with sir walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of kellynch hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of sir walter ' s estimate of the dues of a tenant .  <eos>   what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit ,-- espionage , and treachery ?-- to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge us all !-- here have we been , the whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour , with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear .-- they must take the consequence , if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable !"  <eos>   mr . weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at randalls one day ;-- even mr . woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party .  <eos>   something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow ."  <eos>   " i kept my letter open , that i might send you word how louisa bore her journey , and now i am extremely glad i did , having a great deal to add .  <eos>   ma ' am ," addressing her , " do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane ' s handwriting ?"  <eos>   this was very proper ; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable ; but it should have lasted longer .  <eos>   very well ," exclaimed miss bates , " then i need not be uneasy .  <eos>   sir walter , without hesitation , declared the admiral to be the best - looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and the admiral , with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park , " i thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at taunton .  <eos>   " not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit .-- if one leads you wrong , i am sure the other tells you of it ."  <eos>   let me entreat you , miss woodhouse , to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend .  <eos>   between ourselves , i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme as long as louisa ; it would have kept her a little out of his way .  <eos>   their dress had every advantage , their faces were rather pretty , their spirits extremely good , their manner unembarrassed and pleasant ; they were of consequence at home , and favourites abroad .  <eos>   mr . knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew mr . elton looked up to him .  <eos>   every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting ; but still they were to part .  <eos>   " the worst is over !"  <eos>   she must have found the evening agreeable , mr . knightley , because she had emma ."  <eos>   " i do remember it ," cried emma ; " i perfectly remember it .-- talking about spruce - beer .-- oh !  <eos>   perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy .  <eos>   compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent .  <eos>   he started .  <eos>   emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault .  <eos>   yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it .  <eos>   such might be his constitution ; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room -- and she humanely pointed out the door .  <eos>   " it is too much a matter of fact , but here it is .-- what two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ?"  <eos>   screamed mary , catching hold of her husband , and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable ; and in another moment , henrietta , sinking under the conviction , lost her senses too , and would have fallen on the steps , but for captain benwick and anne , who caught and supported her between them .  <eos>   " mr . martin , i suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ?  <eos>   i have engaged mrs . weston to correspond with me .  <eos>   if we were all like you , i believe we might sit four .  <eos>   .  <eos>   poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could give .  <eos>   this was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to mr . woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry , and only regretted that she had not done it .  <eos>   he was invited to kellynch hall ; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year ; but he never came .  <eos>   she calls you , knightley -- what can she do for mr . cole ?  <eos>   " well , emma , i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister ' s letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure .  <eos>   still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment .  <eos>   there was no comfort in having him in london ; he might as well be at enscombe ; but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse .  <eos>   it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr . martin .  <eos>   " frank was here in february for a fortnight ."  <eos>   so began miss bates ; and mr . knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn , for most resolutely and commandingly did he say ,  <eos>   " yes , papa , it is written out in our second page .  <eos>   lady russell let this pass , and only said in rejoinder , " i own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch , the future lady elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother ' s place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me .  <eos>   circumstances that might swell to half an hour ' s relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to harriet , were not without some degree of witness from emma herself .-- the first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at donwell , where they had been walking some time before emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed !--( harriet could not recall it without a blush .)  <eos>   it was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me ?-- and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner .  <eos>   she cried .--" well !"  <eos>   while either of them protected him and his , hartfield was safe .-- but mr . john knightley must be in london again by the end of the first week in november .  <eos>   they were all three walking about together for an hour or two -- first round the shrubberies of hartfield , and afterwards in highbury .  <eos>   go , and interfere .  <eos>   miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one .  <eos>   her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance , and their visit in general .  <eos>   she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr . elton .  <eos>   but the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and i think he does .  <eos>   no ; there would be a mrs . knightley to throw cold water on every thing .-- extremely disagreeable !  <eos>   once , too , he spoke to her .  <eos>   emma listened , and then coolly said , " i shall not be satisfied , unless he comes ."  <eos>   in he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and her niece , made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle , where sat miss woodhouse ; and till he could find a seat by her , would not sit at all .  <eos>   " did you go then ?  <eos>   but mary did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an elliot , or from not wanting to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed .  <eos>   have you any thing to send or say , besides the ` love ,' which nobody carries ?"  <eos>   time passed on .  <eos>   -- but , in spite of these deficiencies , the wishes , the hopes , the confidence , the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony , were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union .  <eos>   " we will not allow her to do such a thing again :"-- and nodding significantly --" there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed .  <eos>   at this moment i cannot recollect his name , though i have heard it so lately .  <eos>   dear mrs . weston !  <eos>   " from something that he said , my dear emma , i rather imagine --"  <eos>   mrs . goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation -- and but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbey - mill farm , it must have been the whole .  <eos>   he had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied .  <eos>   let me hear from you without delay ; i am impatient for a thousand particulars .  <eos>   but the case is altered now .  <eos>   he ventured among them again , however , though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general .  <eos>   he had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well - judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it .  <eos>   anne , must not it be our mr elliot ?  <eos>   captain weston , who had been considered , especially by the churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .  <eos>   " never !  <eos>   " say nothing , my dear emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of mrs . elton .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas .  <eos>   louisa ' s limbs had escaped .  <eos>   mrs . elton then said , " nobody can think less of dress in general than i do -- but upon such an occasion as this , when every body ' s eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the westons -- who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour -- i would not wish to be inferior to others .  <eos>   " you like it , my emma , as little as i feared .-- i wish our opinions were the same .  <eos>   " he was four - and - twenty the 8th of last june , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day ' s difference -- which is very odd ."  <eos>   nothing to signify .  <eos>   " poor mrs . churchill !  <eos>   perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabella ' s sister , but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of respectful forbearance towards her father .  <eos>   a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line .  <eos>   mrs . weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but emma ' s countenance was as steady as her words .  <eos>   a cousin of mr . suckling , mrs . bragge , had such an infinity of applications ; every body was anxious to be in her family , for she moves in the first circle .  <eos>   it is so with some men .  <eos>   her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour , and a dark bedroom behind , with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance , which there was only one servant in the house to afford , and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath .  <eos>   " and yet ," said anne to herself , as they now moved forward to meet the party , " he has not , perhaps , a more sorrowing heart than i have .  <eos>   her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected .  <eos>   such schemes as these are nothing without numbers .  <eos>   but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness .  <eos>   where i have a regard , i always think a person well - looking .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   how glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner , how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power , and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma ' s farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow -- actually on the morrow ; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner , as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought .  <eos>   i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs . goddard .  <eos>   she had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else ; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double - dyed , and therefore only said in reply ,  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   the stupidest fellow !  <eos>   there was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted .-- she came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone ,  <eos>   a word was put in for a second young cox ; and at last , mr . weston naming one family of cousins who must be included , and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out , it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten , and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of .  <eos>   " then i take it for granted ," observed sir walter , " that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery ."  <eos>   i meant only myself .  <eos>   anne saw the misery of such feelings .  <eos>   ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , i found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour .  <eos>   i could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense .  <eos>   they were of sobering tendency ; they allayed agitation ; they composed , and consequently must make her happier .  <eos>   emma could not forgive her .  <eos>   i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town .  <eos>   this long meadow bordered a lane , which their footpath , at the end of it was to cross , and when the party had all reached the gate of exit , the carriage advancing in the same direction , which had been some time heard , was just coming up , and proved to be admiral croft ' s gig .  <eos>   the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream , was perhaps the most prominent feeling .  <eos>   he said it , she knew , to be contradicted .  <eos>   she goes into the warm bath to - morrow , and for the rest of the week , you know , we are engaged ."  <eos>   only let me be told when i may speak out .-- i wonder whether jane has any suspicion ."  <eos>   and after such success , you know !-- every body said that mr . weston would never marry again .  <eos>   she hoped no one could have said to her , " how could you be so unfeeling to your father ?-- i must , i will tell you truths while i can ."  <eos>   to the great house accordingly they went , to sit the full half hour in the old - fashioned square parlour , with a small carpet and shining floor , to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano - forte and a harp , flower - stands and little tables placed in every direction .  <eos>   unintentionally she returned to that part of the room ; he saw her , and , instantly rising , said , with studied politeness --  <eos>   every thing declared it ; his own attentions , his father ' s hints , his mother - in - law ' s guarded silence ; it was all in unison ; words , conduct , discretion , and indiscretion , told the same story .  <eos>   it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood .  <eos>   he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper ' s room , or a bad butler ' s pantry , but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make him happy , and that whenever he were attached , he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment .  <eos>   mr . knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body .  <eos>   " if not in our dispositions ," she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , " there is a likeness in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own ."  <eos>   weston .-- so it proved ;-- for when happily released from mr . elton , and seated by mr . weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her ,  <eos>   and so forth -- i always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see .  <eos>   exclaimed mr . knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , " no , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation .  <eos>   " what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister !  <eos>   " don ' t class us together , harriet .  <eos>   miss fairfax , i dare say , would not have me if i were to ask her -- and i am very sure i shall never ask her ."  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   they had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last october , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , i was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , i declare i do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in jane ' s letter -- wrote in mr . dixon ' s name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in dublin , and take them back to their country seat , baly - craig , a beautiful place , i fancy .  <eos>   he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions ; over - scrupulous i must say .  <eos>   she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ' s children ever were .  <eos>   with their wealth , their views increased ; their want of a larger house , their inclination for more company .  <eos>   " i dare say she had ."  <eos>   i could not bear to have henry supplanted .-- mr . knightley marry !-- no , i have never had such an idea , and i cannot adopt it now .  <eos>   you are too bountiful !  <eos>   for a few days , every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs . weston had received .  <eos>   she will break it to you better than i can .  <eos>   his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening .  <eos>   we may well say that ` our lot is cast in a goodly heritage .'  <eos>   _perfection_ should not have come quite so soon ."  <eos>   though i think he had better not have married .  <eos>   let those who would be happy be firm .  <eos>   i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant .  <eos>   said emma , as soon as she could speak .  <eos>   she was a dear old asp to me .  <eos>   let us be discreet -- quite on our good behaviour .-- hush !-- you remember those lines -- i forget the poem at this moment :  <eos>   " here is april come !"  <eos>   ah !  <eos>   any thing else i should be most happy to do , at your command -- but my dancing days are over ."  <eos>   you will tell sir walter what we have done , and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had .  <eos>   is he coming , louisa ?"  <eos>   wax - candles in the schoolroom !  <eos>   " well -- if you please ," said mrs . weston rather hesitating , " if you think she will be of any use ."  <eos>   tea passed pleasantly , and nobody seemed in a hurry to move .  <eos>   charles agreed , but declared his resolution of not going away .  <eos>   her observation had been pretty correct .  <eos>   he had inquired after her , she found , slightly , as might suit a former slight acquaintance , seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged , actuated , perhaps , by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet .  <eos>   she will enjoy the scheme , i am sure ; and i do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties .  <eos>   you must see the difference ."  <eos>   and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club !  <eos>   " my dear , you are too particular ," said her husband .  <eos>   if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now , it might augur something .  <eos>   he was afraid not even miss woodhouse "-- he stopt a moment --" or miss smith could inspire him ."  <eos>   " very true ," he gravely replied ; " it was very bad ."  <eos>   i will go and tell charles , and get ready directly .  <eos>   could i mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to mrs . goddard ?  <eos>   " good morning to you ,"-- said he , rising and walking off abruptly .  <eos>   the last night ' s ball seemed lost in the gipsies .  <eos>   lady russell confessed she had expected something better ; but yet " it was an acquaintance worth having ;" and when anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to mr elliot , he agreed to their being nothing in themselves , but still maintained that , as a family connexion , as good company , as those who would collect good company around them , they had their value .  <eos>   she could only offer one solution ; it was , perhaps , for elizabeth ' s sake .  <eos>   elizabeth , may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place ?"  <eos>   poor girl !  <eos>   it did appear -- there was no concealing it -- exactly like the pretence of being in love with her , instead of harriet ; an inconstancy , if real , the most contemptible and abominable !  <eos>   i can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man .  <eos>   emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of mrs . elton ' s voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand .  <eos>   " i presume to observe , sir walter , that , in the way of business , gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with .  <eos>   and now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them .-- she felt that she had been risking her friend ' s happiness on most insufficient grounds .  <eos>   " nay , i had it from you .  <eos>   he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta .  <eos>   let them be sent to donwell .  <eos>   musgrove , either you or i must go ."  <eos>   pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once ."  <eos>   " we want only two more to be just the right number .  <eos>   she would not look again .  <eos>   she had been thinking of him the moment before , as unquestionably sixteen miles distant .-- there was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind .  <eos>   i have never seen either mr . or mrs . elton .  <eos>   " happy for her , to have such a mind as yours at hand !  <eos>   " it is one thing ," said she , presently -- her cheeks in a glow --" to have very good sense in a common way , like every body else , and if there is any thing to say , to sit down and write a letter , and say just what you must , in a short way ; and another , to write verses and charades like this ."  <eos>   she must have found the evening agreeable , mr . knightley , because she had emma ."  <eos>   could a linguist , could a grammarian , could even a mathematician have seen what she did , have witnessed their appearance together , and heard their history of it , without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other ?-- how much more must an imaginist , like herself , be on fire with speculation and foresight !-- especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made .  <eos>   " you will soon be cooler , if you sit still ," said emma .  <eos>   i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs .  <eos>   " yes , you were very cross ; and i do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries .  <eos>   and , by what i understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable .  <eos>   chapter i  <eos>   anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different .  <eos>   i am sure you will not like him ."  <eos>   but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded ."  <eos>   she did not blame lady russell , she did not blame herself for having been guided by her ; but she felt that were any young person , in similar circumstances , to apply to her for counsel , they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness , such uncertain future good .  <eos>   nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma , but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it .  <eos>   " i am glad i have done being in love with him .  <eos>   " if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like jane fairfax ' s .-- of such , one may almost say , that ` the world is not their ' s , nor the world ' s law .'"  <eos>   she promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it , with the intention of finding it a very good scheme .  <eos>   she could not but hear ; she could not avoid answering ,  <eos>   the evil day was put off .  <eos>   she could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly .  <eos>   " a bad thing !  <eos>   but now for louisa .  <eos>   jane came back delighted yesterday .  <eos>   mr . elton and i are very good friends , and nothing more ;" and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel .  <eos>   this moment , if you please .  <eos>   she liked his open manners , but a little less of open - heartedness would have made him a higher character .-- general benevolence , but not general friendship , made a man what he ought to be .-- she could fancy such a man .  <eos>   it will be bad enough for the horses ."  <eos>   such scarecrows as the streets were full of !  <eos>   when the plan was made known to mary , however , there was an end of all peace in it .  <eos>   he was not only pardoned , they were delighted with him .  <eos>   so much the better .  <eos>   " and i am quite serious too , i assure you ," replied mrs . elton gaily , " in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us ."  <eos>   she will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older .  <eos>   one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to emma -- its being fixed for a day within the granted term of frank churchill ' s stay in surry ; for , in spite of mr . weston ' s confidence , she could not think it so very impossible that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight .  <eos>   her own emotions still kept her fixed .  <eos>   whenever james goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us .  <eos>   and i am sure our thanks are due to you , mrs . weston , on that score .  <eos>   to talk would be only to irritate .-- she wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday .-- harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful .  <eos>   she dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her .  <eos>   but soon afterwards , rising and pacing the room , he observed sarcastically --  <eos>   he was to come to breakfast , but not at the cottage , though that had been proposed at first ; but then he had been pressed to come to the great house instead , and he seemed afraid of being in mrs charles musgrove ' s way , on account of the child , and therefore , somehow , they hardly knew how , it ended in charles ' s being to meet him to breakfast at his father ' s .  <eos>   i shall never forget his happiness .  <eos>   emma ' s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at mr .  <eos>   no more is emma .  <eos>   she is reserved , more reserved , i think , than she used to be -- and i love an open temper .  <eos>   there could be no harm in a scheme , a mere passive scheme .  <eos>   at the end of that period , lady russell ' s politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self - threatenings of the past became in a decided tone , " i must call on mrs croft ; i really must call upon her soon .  <eos>   well , that must be infinitely provoking !  <eos>   here was a fortune at once ; besides which , there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war ; and he was sure captain wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy .  <eos>   if i come , i shall be cross ."  <eos>   if i find him conversable , i shall be glad of his acquaintance ; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb , he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts ."  <eos>   chapter xiii  <eos>   are you in any doubt as to that ?  <eos>   " so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them !  <eos>   anne found a nice seat for her , on a dry sunny bank , under the hedge - row , in which she had no doubt of their still being , in some spot or other .  <eos>   if it was not for the drawback of her illness -- but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin , and looking very poorly .  <eos>   at the time of the ballroom ' s being built , suppers had not been in question ; and a small card - room adjoining , was the only addition .  <eos>   to the great house accordingly they went , to sit the full half hour in the old - fashioned square parlour , with a small carpet and shining floor , to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano - forte and a harp , flower - stands and little tables placed in every direction .  <eos>   " but still , not near enough to give me a chance of being right , if we think differently ."  <eos>   this had been a proof of life , however , of service to her sister ; and henrietta , though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with louisa , was kept , by the agitation of hope and fear , from a return of her own insensibility .  <eos>   " this is a pleasure ," said he , in rather a low voice , " coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated .  <eos>   is it kingdom ?  <eos>   he was silent .  <eos>   in fact , anne could never see the crape round his hat , without fearing that she was the inexcusable one , in attributing to him such imaginations ; for though his marriage had not been very happy , still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved .  <eos>   " she is dead !  <eos>   said he .  <eos>   " mr . elton ' s manners are not perfect ," replied emma ; " but where there is a wish to please , one ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great deal .  <eos>   what are harriet smith ' s claims , either of birth , nature or education , to any connexion higher than robert martin ?  <eos>   " well -- if you advise it .-- but ( with a smile ) if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall i say ?  <eos>   that would be a noble thing , indeed , for henrietta !  <eos>   mrs . elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly .  <eos>   " it will not do ," whispered frank to emma ; " they are most of them affronted .  <eos>   " it is over !  <eos>   harriet could just answer , " oh !  <eos>   were the first words which burst from captain wentworth , in a tone of despair , and as if all his own strength were gone .  <eos>   mr . and mrs . john knightley were to come down in august , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .  <eos>   " but will there be good room for five couple ?-- i really do not think there will ."  <eos>   to know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort !-- she does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves .  <eos>   " what shall you do !  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   now do not you feel that you had ?  <eos>   these kind of things are very well at christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer .  <eos>   " whoever might be her parents ," said mr . knightley , " whoever may have had the charge of her , it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society .  <eos>   the child ' s situation put the visit entirely aside ; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference , even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account .  <eos>   " i have made a most wretched discovery ," said he , after a short pause .-- " i have been here a week to - morrow -- half my time .  <eos>   under a bright mid - day sun , at almost midsummer , mr . woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage , with one window down , to partake of this al - fresco party ; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the abbey , especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning , he was happily placed , quite at his ease , ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved , and advise every body to come and sit down , and not to heat themselves .-- mrs . weston , who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired , and sit all the time with him , remained , when all the others were invited or persuaded out , his patient listener and sympathiser .  <eos>   if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child , i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like .  <eos>   she must be taken to their house ; all must go to their house ; and await the surgeon ' s arrival there .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   the only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps .  <eos>   mrs . churchill was unwell -- far too unwell to do without him ; she had been in a very suffering state ( so said her husband ) when writing to her nephew two days before , though from her usual unwillingness to give pain , and constant habit of never thinking of herself , she had not mentioned it ; but now she was too ill to trifle , and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay .  <eos>   cried emma , shaking her head .--" ah !  <eos>   " your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr . elton ' s marrying , harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _me_ .  <eos>   he will connect himself well if he can ."  <eos>   she was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited mr . woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip .  <eos>   they had mr elliot too .  <eos>   i have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule .  <eos>   even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it .  <eos>   " you like it , my emma , as little as i feared .-- i wish our opinions were the same .  <eos>   thy ready wit the word will soon supply .  <eos>   the musgroves , like their houses , were in a state of alteration , perhaps of improvement .  <eos>   she meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the abbey mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future .  <eos>   such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown .-- i dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet ,  <eos>   " i felt my luck , admiral , i assure you ;" replied captain wentworth , seriously .  <eos>   she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well .  <eos>   he was very much vexed .  <eos>   she knew the importance of it , and said every thing in her power to do it away .  <eos>   she knew a family near maple grove who had tried it , and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter .  <eos>   or is it too short ?"  <eos>   he quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in london , which afforded him a favourable opening .  <eos>   elton ?-- that will be a favour indeed !  <eos>   if they must dance , they had better dance at randalls .  <eos>   for miss ----------, read miss smith .  <eos>   i think mr . john knightley very far from looking well ."  <eos>   in respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are .  <eos>   there will be enough of them , in all probability , to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need .  <eos>   her father ' s feelings were quite distinct .  <eos>   and now i come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation .  <eos>   one man ' s ways may be as good as another ' s , but we all like our own best .  <eos>   " jane !"  <eos>   the miss musgroves were not at all tired , and mary was either offended , by not being asked before any of the others , or what louisa called the elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise .  <eos>   all looked up to them .  <eos>   knightley was at hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for saturday ."  <eos>   it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand ."  <eos>   i do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one ' s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation .  <eos>   " i will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body ' s assistance ."  <eos>   the admiral ' s kind urgency came in support of his wife ' s ; they would not be refused ; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner , and captain wentworth , without saying a word , turned to her , and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   i am almost ashamed to say it ."  <eos>   where shall we sit ?  <eos>   this wretched note was the finale of emma ' s breakfast .  <eos>   isabella then went to emma ; but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away ; and they were still discussing the point , when mr . knightley , who had left the room immediately after his brother ' s first report of the snow , came back again , and told them that he had been out of doors to examine , and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home , whenever they liked it , either now or an hour hence .  <eos>   intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question .  <eos>   " he will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drop ' s one ' s scissors , or anything that happens .  <eos>   such an immense plantation all round it !  <eos>   " you speak as if you envied him ."  <eos>   it had then seemed the object nearest her heart , that dr shirley , the rector , who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office , but was now growing too infirm for many of them , should be quite fixed on engaging a curate ; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford , and should give charles hayter the promise of it .  <eos>   it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent , or so indignant ; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball , for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree .  <eos>   " ay , true enough ," ( with a deep sigh ) " only june ."  <eos>   " a great many things , i assure you .  <eos>   " merely gowland ," he supposed .  <eos>   it was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could emma procure as to what he truly was .  <eos>   but ," ( checking himself ), " you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler ' s room .  <eos>   let them be sent to donwell .  <eos>   to talk would be only to irritate .-- she wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday .-- harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful .  <eos>   there was a languor , a want of spirits , a want of union , which could not be got over .  <eos>   " well , if he have nothing else to recommend him , he will be a treasure at highbury .  <eos>   her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless .  <eos>   " of all horrid things , leave - taking is the worst ."  <eos>   i think miss fairfax dances very well ; and mrs . weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in england .  <eos>   miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last !  <eos>   she absolutely refused to allow me , which i then thought most unreasonable .  <eos>   you may believe me , mrs . weston .  <eos>   he did not mean to complain , however .  <eos>   " such an imagination has crossed me , i own , emma ; and if it never occurred to you before , you may as well take it into consideration now ."  <eos>   she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority , but she could not doubt his being rich ; and , in favour of his constancy , she had no reason to believe him married .  <eos>   you know , mrs . weston , you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves .  <eos>   if one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the coles , for instance .  <eos>   harriet unfolded the parcel , and she looked on with impatience .  <eos>   " i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls ."  <eos>   but do come in .  <eos>   everything that revolts other people , low company , paltry rooms , foul air , disgusting associations are inviting to you .  <eos>   it was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue .  <eos>   " well , mrs . weston ," said emma triumphantly when he left them , " what do you say now to mr . knightley ' s marrying jane fairfax ?"  <eos>   oh , said i , my dear , i did say as much as i could .  <eos>   it was well to have a comfort in store on harriet ' s behalf , though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom ; for evil in that quarter was at hand .  <eos>   ` oh !'  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " she had set out from mrs . goddard ' s half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at ford ' s ."  <eos>   what has he to do with books ?  <eos>   miss woodhouse , what do you think has happened !"  <eos>   " i do not pretend to fix on times or places , but i must tell you that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage ."  <eos>   " my dear jane , say no more about it .  <eos>   papa , we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married .  <eos>   " then it would not be so strong a sense .  <eos>   " we must ask mr . and mrs . weston to dine with us , while isabella is here ."  <eos>   " that will never be , however , i can assure you .  <eos>   but why so ?-- i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too ."  <eos>   and i hate italian singing .-- there is no understanding a word of it .  <eos>   jane , do you know i always fancy mr . dixon like mr . john knightley .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which i was not at all pleased with .  <eos>   " this was really his ," said harriet .--" do not you remember one morning ?-- no , i dare say you do not .  <eos>   and woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .  <eos>   your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls .  <eos>   they did not know .  <eos>   " you would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ?  <eos>   he perfectly knew his own meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend ,-- but acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned at all ,-- he resumed the subject of his own passion , and was very urgent for a favourable answer .  <eos>   " yes ," said mrs smith more doubtingly , " sometimes it may , though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe .  <eos>   " isabella and emma both write beautifully ," said mr . woodhouse ; " and always did .  <eos>   another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose ; but it was at the other end of the house , and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it .  <eos>   she only knew that henrietta was at home again ; and that louisa , though considered to be recovering fast , was still in lyme ; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening , when a thicker letter than usual from mary was delivered to her ; and , to quicken the pleasure and surprise , with admiral and mrs croft ' s compliments .  <eos>   --  <eos>   " you know what you are about ."  <eos>   at last , with some hesitation , harriet said --  <eos>   the mistake had been slight .  <eos>   she had seen the same frederick wentworth .  <eos>   emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off .  <eos>   lord bless me !  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " i do not offer it for miss smith ' s collection ," said he .  <eos>   in half a minute they were together .  <eos>   bates ?"  <eos>   there will not be time for any thing ."  <eos>   " well , whenever it suits you .  <eos>   frank ' s was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance .  <eos>   " a strong mind , with sweetness of manner ," made the first and the last of the description .  <eos>   excellent fellow .  <eos>   if mr . and mrs . weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done ."  <eos>   he was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said ,  <eos>   yet he would speak .  <eos>   in any other place sir walter might judge for himself ; and would be looked up to , as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household ."  <eos>   she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance , and was beyond the reach of mr . weston ' s hint .  <eos>   could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied .-- let him but continue the same mr . knightley to her and her father , the same mr . knightley to all the world ; let donwell and hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured .-- marriage , in fact , would not do for her .  <eos>   " no , no ; your room is full enough .  <eos>   i must think your statement by no means fair .  <eos>   he will find an _addition_ to the society of highbury when he comes again ; that is , if i may presume to call myself an addition .  <eos>   she only attempted to say , " how do you do ?  <eos>   " and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy ?-- the campbells , the dixons , did none of them know of the engagement ?"  <eos>   " my brother ," whispered one of the girls ; " mamma is thinking of poor richard ."  <eos>   " mr . elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and i have a great regard for him .  <eos>   jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from mr . dixon , i mean -- i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for colonel and mrs . campbell were very particular about their daughter ' s not walking out often with only mr . dixon , for which i do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland ; and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself .  <eos>   he sat a little while in doubt .  <eos>   to isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her father ' s account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at randalls .  <eos>   and , after proceeding a few steps , she added -- " i stopped you ungraciously , just now , mr . knightley , and , i am afraid , gave you pain .-- but if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me .-- i will hear whatever you like .  <eos>   but they have a great many to provide for ; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not , it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed ."  <eos>   i always say a woman cannot have too many resources -- and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society ."  <eos>   but why must she consent to be with the eltons ?-- here is quite a separate puzzle ."  <eos>   they had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last october , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , i was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , i declare i do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in jane ' s letter -- wrote in mr . dixon ' s name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in dublin , and take them back to their country seat , baly - craig , a beautiful place , i fancy .  <eos>   weston ."  <eos>   " very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so ."  <eos>   .  <eos>   cried harriet , colouring , and astonished .  <eos>   " yes , i would .  <eos>   he presently added , with a smile ,  <eos>   do you recommend this side ?-- well , i am sure , mr . churchill -- only it seems too good -- but just as you please .  <eos>   she hoped it was not so .  <eos>   i am amazed that you should think of such a thing ."  <eos>   " yes , yes , to the inn ," repeated captain wentworth , comparatively collected , and eager to be doing something .  <eos>   it would be almost beginning their life of civility again .  <eos>   it was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harriet ' s coming to hartfield .  <eos>   it was a very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening .  <eos>   " upon my word it would ," replied mary .  <eos>   exclaimed mr . knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , " no , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation .  <eos>   she will break it to you better than i can .  <eos>   i thought it must be so .  <eos>   before the middle of the next day , he was at hartfield ; and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme .  <eos>   " i do not often walk this way _now_ ," said emma , as they proceeded , " but _then_ there will be an inducement , and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges , gates , pools and pollards of this part of highbury ."  <eos>   she had never been quite well since the time of their daughter ' s marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort .  <eos>   i admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me .  <eos>   " yes , yes , pray pass _me_ ," added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; " _i_ have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse , or any other young lady .  <eos>   harriet , here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts .  <eos>   mr . knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , mr . woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the bates ' s , said --  <eos>   no !--( in an accent meant to be insinuating )-- i am sure you have seen and understood me ."  <eos>   command yourself enough to say no more , and i will endeavour to forget it ."  <eos>   mr . churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife ' s : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence !  <eos>   " my dear , how am i to get so far ?  <eos>   " phoo !  <eos>   what shall i say ?"  <eos>   and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfax ' s sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , " this is very bad .-- he had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily .-- she must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could .  <eos>   it opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession .  <eos>   if a man had not a wife , he soon wants to be afloat again ."  <eos>   their intercourse was painful enough by letter .  <eos>   and what is her attraction ?  <eos>   the evil day was put off .  <eos>   the conclusion of her visit , however , was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined .  <eos>   anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech , and entered into the subject , as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man , though here it was good of a lower standard , for what could be offered but general acquiescence ?  <eos>   interrupted emma , " there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   mr . perry had been to mrs . goddard ' s to attend a sick child , and miss nash had seen him , and he had told miss nash , that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park , he had met mr . elton , and found to his great surprize , that mr . elton was actually on his road to london , and not meaning to return till the morrow , though it was the whist - club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and mr . perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ; mr . elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious .  <eos>   " well ," said mrs . elton , laughing , " we shall see ."  <eos>   " oh god !  <eos>   harriet said , " very true ," and she " would not think about it ;" but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else ; and emma , at last , in order to put the martins out of her head , was obliged to hurry on the news , which she had meant to give with so much tender caution ; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry , ashamed or only amused , at such a state of mind in poor harriet -- such a conclusion of mr . elton ' s importance with her !  <eos>   no sacrifice on any side worth the name .  <eos>   no !  <eos>   you saw how hysterical i was yesterday ."  <eos>   " ah !"  <eos>   " what shall you do !  <eos>   it must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement .  <eos>   she had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine - and - twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions ; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever , but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet - blood within the next twelvemonth or two .  <eos>   my blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of , and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier ."  <eos>   i see no advantage in consulting miss bates ."  <eos>   " will you ?"  <eos>   " she should always send for perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment .  <eos>   at the same time , however , it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin , and to know that the future owner of kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman , and had an air of good sense .  <eos>   but here you are in bath , and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot .  <eos>   what do you think of him ?  <eos>   " perry !"  <eos>   i should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path .  <eos>   it was as much as emma could bear , without being impolite .  <eos>   " and so , i made her go .  <eos>   he remained at hartfield after all the rest , his thoughts full of what he had seen ; so full , that when the candles came to assist his observations , he must -- yes , he certainly must , as a friend -- an anxious friend -- give emma some hint , ask her some question .  <eos>   in the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings ' coming had been united , such as the last accounts of mrs . churchill , whose health seemed every day to supply a different report , and the situation of mrs . weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child , as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it .  <eos>   chapter ix  <eos>   " but , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_ ?  <eos>   " well ," said he , in a deliberating manner , " for five minutes , perhaps ."  <eos>   " about jane fairfax .  <eos>   the frank churchill so long talked of , so high in interest , was actually before her -- he was presented to her , and she did not think too much had been said in his praise ; he was a _very_ good looking young man ; height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father ' s ; he looked quick and sensible .  <eos>   " no ," said emma , laughing ; " but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again .  <eos>   she has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself .  <eos>   that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man , and , moreover , a single man at the time , she had a fond dependence on no human creature ' s having heard of it from him .  <eos>   as yet , you have seen nothing of bath .  <eos>   a very few days had passed after this adventure , when harriet came one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began :  <eos>   he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion , by giving her very proper attention , after the introduction had passed .  <eos>   he continued at the window ; and after calmly and politely saying , " i hope the little boy is better ," was silent .  <eos>   chapter ix  <eos>   have not i some right to complain ?  <eos>   i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever .  <eos>   there are people , who the more you do for them , the less they will do for themselves .  <eos>   then she is no rule for mrs . churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld ."  <eos>   with these supports , she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the crofts , which , with lady russell , still resident in kellynch , and mary fixed only three miles off , must be anticipated , need not involve any particular awkwardness .  <eos>   it stood the record of many sensations of pain , once severe , but now softened ; and of some instances of relenting feeling , some breathings of friendship and reconciliation , which could never be looked for again , and which could never cease to be dear .  <eos>   they think charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell , and that therefore , she persuaded anne to refuse him ."  <eos>   mr . elton made his appearance .  <eos>   captain wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor benwick had been to fanny harville , or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change .  <eos>   i am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable , and wish i could be acquainted with him too ; but i have my usual luck : i am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on ; always the last of my family to be noticed .  <eos>   precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer ' s hands ; but sir walter had improved it by adding , for the information of himself and his family , these words , after the date of mary ' s birth -- " married , december , , charles , son and heir of charles musgrove , esq .  <eos>   " mermaids and sharks !  <eos>   in one respect he is the object of my envy ."  <eos>   mr . perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case , and he told him so ; and mr . elton only looked very conscious and smiling , and rode off in great spirits .  <eos>   let my father ' s servant go with you .-- let me order the carriage .  <eos>   these kind of things are very well at christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer .  <eos>   " and not known to him , perhaps , so soon ."  <eos>   this is great news , indeed .  <eos>   it is what we happily have never known any thing of ; but it must be a life of misery .  <eos>   her arm was pressed again , as he added , in a more broken and subdued accent , " the feelings of the warmest friendship -- indignation -- abominable scoundrel !"  <eos>   but dear miss woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away .-- whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end !  <eos>   they were combined only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep concern .  <eos>   my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days .  <eos>   some laughed , and answered good - humouredly .  <eos>   mr . elton had retreated into the card - room , looking ( emma trusted ) very foolish .  <eos>   had i done as i ought !  <eos>   they had a very fine day for box hill ; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement , accommodation , and punctuality , were in favour of a pleasant party .  <eos>   cried harriet indignantly .--" oh !  <eos>   it was hot ; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered , dispersed way , scarcely any three together , they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes , which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river , seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds .-- it led to nothing ; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars , which seemed intended , in their erection , to give the appearance of an approach to the house , which never had been there .  <eos>   something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow ."  <eos>   will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place , and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible ?  <eos>   " it is hotter to - day ."  <eos>   " i hope he does ," replied mr . knightley coolly , and resuming the letter .  <eos>   " very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so ."  <eos>   should not this be enough for a sailor , who has had no society among women to make him nice ?"  <eos>   for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am , and as i am ."  <eos>   " has he so !-- then i know nothing of mr . elton .  <eos>   it was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ), as well as miss smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent -- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and harriet not much otherwise , emma would not interfere with .  <eos>   for i think you have a little cold , and patty has been washing the kitchen .'--` oh !  <eos>   mrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter .  <eos>   my dear sir , you are too obliging .-- is there nobody you would not rather ?-- i am not helpless .  <eos>   depend upon it , that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish , wherever he goes .  <eos>   no -- till cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head .  <eos>   " i suspect ," said sir walter coolly , " that admiral croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall .  <eos>   " putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together ," said captain wentworth , " we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence , that you should not be introduced to your cousin ."  <eos>   i shall leave off while i am well ."  <eos>   he might be able to join them in the evening , but certainly not to dinner .  <eos>   " a knock at the door !  <eos>   " you are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and i must set you right .-- i am not in want of that sort of compassion .  <eos>   " but i thought you would .  <eos>   emma laughed , and replied : " but i had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people .  <eos>   " no , indeed you are mistaken ."  <eos>   you made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all that can be said ."  <eos>   whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof ; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each ; they could not but be reverted to ; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him , in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth .  <eos>   we are all very well pleased , however , for though it is not equal to her marrying captain wentworth , it is infinitely better than charles hayter ; and mr musgrove has written his consent , and captain benwick is expected to - day .  <eos>   " you had better go on ," said she .  <eos>   the randalls party agreed to it immediately ; and after a pretty long speech from miss bates , which few persons listened to , she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouse ' s most obliging invitation .  <eos>   .  <eos>   i am sure i do not know who is not ."  <eos>   i have an idea he was standing just here ."  <eos>   " i wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too .  <eos>   there is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere .-- she is _not_ to be with the _dixons_ .  <eos>   " thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend .  <eos>   " no , upon no account in the world , mr . weston ; i am much obliged to you for reminding me .  <eos>   of pride , indeed , there was , perhaps , scarcely enough ; his indifference to a confusion of rank , bordered too much on inelegance of mind .  <eos>   and it always ended in " kitty , a fair but frozen maid ."  <eos>   how those little fingers of yours fly about !"  <eos>   but mrs . dixon must be very much disappointed .  <eos>   her next beginning was ,  <eos>   miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence ; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs . cole ' s , turned to frank churchill .  <eos>   " i certainly do forget to think of _her_ ," said emma , " as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend ."  <eos>   they seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it .  <eos>   " but have you really heard of nothing ?"  <eos>   when the ladies returned to the drawing - room after dinner , emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties ;-- with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs . elton engross jane fairfax and slight herself .  <eos>   but i kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as i dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment ."  <eos>   mr . weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to mrs . weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room .  <eos>   it is a sort of prologue to the play , a motto to the chapter ; and will be soon followed by matter - of - fact prose ."  <eos>   but mary did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an elliot , or from not wanting to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed .  <eos>   i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls .  <eos>   i wish i may not sink into ` poor emma ' with him at once .-- his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther ."  <eos>   not to wait upon a bride is very remiss .  <eos>   chapter xvi  <eos>   " till i have a letter from colonel campbell ," said she , in a voice of forced calmness , " i can imagine nothing with any confidence .  <eos>   miss woodhouse , must you be going ?-- you seem but just come -- so very obliging of you ."  <eos>   i think very well of mr . elton , and this is the only way i have of doing him a service ."  <eos>   it was no more than a wish .  <eos>   to her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of james , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little .  <eos>   they were evidently in excellent spirits , and she was soon to listen to the causes .  <eos>   and here , instead of its being a matter of condolence , it turns out to be one of congratulation .-- i congratulate you , mr . weston , with all my heart , on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter ."  <eos>   when she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to mr . dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself .  <eos>   there is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that i could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore .  <eos>   i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see .  <eos>   they were evidently in excellent spirits , and she was soon to listen to the causes .  <eos>   he looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said ,  <eos>   perry ."  <eos>   " it was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face ."  <eos>   my emma , does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other ?"  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   it is my daily errand .  <eos>   that lady russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again , than when she does not ; but sir walter ' s continuing in singleness requires explanation .  <eos>   how nicely you talk ; i love to hear you .  <eos>   ` nobody was ever so fortunate as herself !'  <eos>   it would be almost beginning their life of civility again .  <eos>   perfectly remember mrs . perry ' s coming .-- extraordinary dream , indeed !"  <eos>   nobody can be more devoted to home than i am .  <eos>   frank ' s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her .  <eos>   " no , it by no means wanted strength -- it was not a large hand , but very clear and certainly strong .  <eos>   she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction ."  <eos>   " he came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner ."  <eos>   how she could have been so deceived !-- he protested that he had never thought seriously of harriet -- never !  <eos>   " here is his answer , if you like to see it ."  <eos>   she might talk on ; and if he wanted to say any thing himself , he would only talk louder , and drown her voice .  <eos>   we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief ."  <eos>   he had an affectionate heart .  <eos>   emma , i must tell you what you will not ask , though i may wish it unsaid the next moment ."  <eos>   mrs clay was right .  <eos>   you , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _some_ ,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her .-- this is not pleasant to you , emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but i must , i will ,-- i will tell you truths while i can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   he seemed to me very well off as he was .  <eos>   he thanked her , observing , " how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment !  <eos>   and i always thought you meant it ."  <eos>   i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other .  <eos>   " with a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time ," said mr . knightley , laughing , " and i agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing .  <eos>   he thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence .  <eos>   my dear sir , how are you this morning ?  <eos>   allowances , large allowances , she knew , must be made for the ideas of those who spoke .  <eos>   emma did not want to be classed with the mrs . eltons , the mrs . perrys , and the mrs . coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself -- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned miss bates farther as to her niece ' s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist .  <eos>   i would be understood to mean , that it can be only weak , irresolute characters , ( whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance ,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience , an oppression for ever ."  <eos>   emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement , and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends -- for the house was taken for may and june .  <eos>   but she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and elizabeth .  <eos>   it is so much beyond any thing i deserve .  <eos>   you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment ."  <eos>   it ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency .  <eos>   the joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined .  <eos>   she saw in a moment all the possible good .  <eos>   poor dear jane was talking of it just now .-- ` you must go ,' said she .  <eos>   " i am not fond of dinner - visiting ," said he --" i never was .  <eos>   " they told me something ," said harriet rather hesitatingly ;" but it is nothing of any consequence ."  <eos>   let no name ever pass our lips .  <eos>   his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel wallis ' s companion might have as good a figure as colonel wallis , and certainly was not sandy - haired .  <eos>   " my dear sir , do not make a stranger of me ."  <eos>   while she talked of his son , mr . weston ' s attention was chained ; but when she got to maple grove , he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to , and with happy smiles must hurry away .  <eos>   " the sooner every party breaks up , the better ."  <eos>   mr . weston had accompanied her to mrs . bates ' s , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs . bates ' s parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .  <eos>   " how delighted i am to see you again !  <eos>   how that visit was to be acknowledged -- what would be necessary -- and what might be safest , had been a point of some doubtful consideration .  <eos>   i always forgot ."  <eos>   when lady russell not long afterwards , was entering bath on a wet afternoon , and driving through the long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place , amidst the dash of other carriages , the heavy rumble of carts and drays , the bawling of newspapermen , muffin - men and milkmen , and the ceaseless clink of pattens , she made no complaint .  <eos>   his goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible .  <eos>   he had the curacy of monkford , you know , sir walter , some time back , for two or three years .  <eos>   " yes ," said mr . john knightley presently , with some slyness , " he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you ."  <eos>   if he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while i was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you .  <eos>   she was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness , among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past , which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it .  <eos>   this charade !-- if i had studied a twelvemonth , i could never have made any thing like it ."  <eos>   a very few days more , and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch , and mr musgrove had called on him , and come back warm in his praise , and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross , by the end of another week .  <eos>   he is the very best young man -- but , my dear jane , if you remember , i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr . perry .  <eos>   of course , he must be sorry to lose her -- they must be all sorry .  <eos>   she hardly knew yet what mr . knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- she even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .  <eos>   his ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer .  <eos>   " there is no denying it ," he replied .  <eos>   or a mermaid ?  <eos>   " thank you , but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , i do not wish to be giving any body trouble ."  <eos>   she thinks so little of her own beauty .  <eos>   and i need not bring the whole family , you know ."  <eos>   it had been in situation .  <eos>   she talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for emma ' s attention ; it was soon gone to brunswick square or to donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when mrs . weston ended with , " we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but i hope it will soon come ," she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for .  <eos>   something occurred while they were at hartfield , to make emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave .  <eos>   this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection .  <eos>   it was well that he took every body ' s joy for granted , or he might not have thought either mr . woodhouse or mr . knightley particularly delighted .  <eos>   in a worldly view , he had nothing to gain by being on terms with sir walter ; nothing to risk by a state of variance .  <eos>   how inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct !  <eos>   surprizes are foolish things .  <eos>   she was a benevolent , charitable , good woman , and capable of strong attachments , most correct in her conduct , strict in her notions of decorum , and with manners that were held a standard of good - breeding .  <eos>   " i mean that he has done it ," answered mr . knightley , with smiling but determined decision , " and been accepted ."  <eos>   weston was alone in the drawing - room :-- but hardly had they been told of the baby , and mr . woodhouse received the thanks for coming , which he asked for , when a glimpse was caught through the blind , of two figures passing near the window .  <eos>   at first , they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations ; but , after a while , captain wentworth , exerting himself , said --  <eos>   emma and harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in emma ' s opinion , had been talking enough of mr . elton for that day .  <eos>   she had a cultivated mind , and was , generally speaking , rational and consistent ; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry ; she had a value for rank and consequence , which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them .  <eos>   i do not want to say more than is necessary -- i am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done , and i dare say you understand me ."  <eos>   we talked it all over with mr . weston last night .  <eos>   no , no ;-- every feeling revolts .  <eos>   " elegant , agreeable manners , i was prepared for ," said he ; " but i confess that , considering every thing , i had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs .  <eos>   i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , emma .  <eos>   we are so very airy !  <eos>   i should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning .  <eos>   go to - day , go to - day .  <eos>   there was merit in every drawing -- in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same .  <eos>   -- and in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded with , " he will soon be gone .  <eos>   he saw that emma had soon made it out , and found it highly entertaining , though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure ; for she said , " nonsense !  <eos>   " i do not think he is conceited either , in general ," said harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; " at least , he is very good natured , and i shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that i should -- and certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable .  <eos>   a poor widow barely able to live , between thirty and forty ; a mere mrs smith , an every - day mrs smith , of all people and all names in the world , to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot , and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of england and ireland !  <eos>   " phoo !  <eos>   vigorous , decided , with sentiments to a certain point , not coarse .  <eos>   the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other .  <eos>   harriet was a little distressed -- did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend ' s approbation , emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations .-- harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at astley ' s , and the dinner the next day ; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight .  <eos>   i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him ; he sent in letters , but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth .  <eos>   yes , next week .  <eos>   nay , he appeared so much otherwise , that his daughter ' s courage failed .  <eos>   they would be very much pleased ."  <eos>   leave it all to me .  <eos>   but after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct .  <eos>   " oh !"  <eos>   elton !"  <eos>   " well ," said she to herself , " this is most strange !-- after i had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave harriet ill behind !-- most strange indeed !-- but there is , i believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination -- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with mr . elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with harriet ; but still , he cannot refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked .  <eos>   i saw her as i came in ; she was standing in the entrance .  <eos>   i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it ."  <eos>   there was no end of miss elliot ' s charms ."  <eos>   she knew herself to be of the first utility to the child ; and what was it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant , making himself agreeable to others ?  <eos>   there is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance .  <eos>   i am not one of those who have witty things at every body ' s service .  <eos>   that was your doing , papa .  <eos>   " mr . elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and i have a great regard for him .  <eos>   if he had but asked who the party were !  <eos>   " i think she must be here soon ," said he .  <eos>   the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing - room when mr . weston made his appearance among them .  <eos>   " if i had set my heart on mr . elton ' s marrying harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself .  <eos>   i am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating .-- i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties ."  <eos>   i have really for some time past , for at least these three months , cared nothing about him .  <eos>   my only doubt is , whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish .  <eos>   it would be a great comfort to mr . weston , as he grew older -- and even mr . weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense , the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home ; and mrs . weston -- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her ; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach , should not have their powers in exercise again .  <eos>   he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment .  <eos>   " and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells ."  <eos>   in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card - tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and in the proper order .  <eos>   with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body ' s feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body ' s destiny .  <eos>   the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any body to .  <eos>   charles , being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case , only nodded in reply , and walked away .  <eos>   i saw you first in february ."  <eos>   " i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject ," replied emma , smiling ; " but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ?"  <eos>   " here ," resumed harriet , turning to her box again , " here is something still more valuable , i mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did ."  <eos>   " they walked , i conclude .  <eos>   miss carteret , with still less to say , was so plain and so awkward , that she would never have been tolerated in camden place but for her birth .  <eos>   elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment .  <eos>   a name that i am so very well acquainted with ; knew the gentleman so well by sight ; seen him a hundred times ; came to consult me once , i remember , about a trespass of one of his neighbours ; farmer ' s man breaking into his orchard ; wall torn down ; apples stolen ; caught in the fact ; and afterwards , contrary to my judgement , submitted to an amicable compromise .  <eos>   isabella turned to mrs . weston for her approbation of the plan .  <eos>   exactly so .  <eos>   " this is the luxury of a large party ," said she :--" one can get near every body , and say every thing .  <eos>   emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful .  <eos>   she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain wentworth at the hall : those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her ; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and captain wentworth never meeting anywhere .  <eos>   she read , and was surprized .  <eos>   is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase ?-- your yorkshire friend -- your correspondent in yorkshire ;-- that would be the way , i suppose , if i were very bad .-- no , i can pronounce his name without the smallest distress .  <eos>   oh lord !  <eos>   cried emma , after a moment ' s pause --" what do you mean ?-- good heaven !  <eos>   -- ` i can see nobody ,' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were .  <eos>   as long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness :-- what must be at last , had better be soon .  <eos>   she had often observed the change , to almost the same extent .-- harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him -- and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet .  <eos>   it would be going only to multiply trouble to the others , and increase his own distress ; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon .  <eos>   " good god !"  <eos>   a man at his age -- what is he ?-- three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that .  <eos>   so considerate !-- but however , she is so far from well , that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home , and try an air that always agrees with her ; and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her -- and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here , than go to ireland , if she is unwell .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   i perfectly understand your situation , however , miss woodhouse -- ( looking towards mr . woodhouse ), your father ' s state of health must be a great drawback .  <eos>   " there were misunderstandings between them , emma ; he said so expressly .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   there can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both occasionally thinking of captain benwick , from this time .  <eos>   the pains i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views !  <eos>   her curiosity was greatly excited .  <eos>   he is going to kingston .  <eos>   something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and mr . weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for randalls .  <eos>   " you speak as if you envied him ."  <eos>   not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own !  <eos>   she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ' s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home .  <eos>   my dear emma , i am longing to talk to you .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   " no , sir ," replied his son , laughing , " i seem to have had it from nobody .-- very odd !-- i really was persuaded of mrs . weston ' s having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream .  <eos>   lady russell said not another word , willing to leave the matter to its own operation ; and believing that , could mr elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself !-- she believed , in short , what anne did not believe .  <eos>   emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned .  <eos>   she had a great wish to see him .  <eos>   my uncle has been too good for me to encroach .-- i must still add to this long letter .  <eos>   but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot , that she did not hear the appeal .  <eos>   every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married ."  <eos>   --" at a watering - place , or in a common london acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points .  <eos>   it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already .  <eos>   she had no doubt of what mr . weston was often thinking about .  <eos>   five couple are nothing , when one thinks seriously about it .  <eos>   and is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ?  <eos>   and as to my father , i really should not have thought that he , who has kept himself single so long for our sakes , need be suspected now .  <eos>   till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar - bone was soon replaced , and though mr robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew ' s state , as to give the information of captain wentworth ' s visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before .  <eos>   " yes ," said jane , " we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing ."  <eos>   her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of ;-- but if he , who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two , were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away , it would be very distressing .  <eos>   very much grieved and concerned -- i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning ."  <eos>   " my feelings , you see , did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth ."  <eos>   it was a reference to the future , which anne , after a little observation , felt she must submit to .  <eos>   she was quite one of her worthies -- the most amiable , affable , delightful woman -- just as accomplished and condescending as mrs . elton meant to be considered .  <eos>   " i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me .  <eos>   i behaved shamefully .  <eos>   she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain wentworth at the hall : those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her ; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and captain wentworth never meeting anywhere .  <eos>   you can send for us , you know , at a moment ' s notice , if anything is the matter ; but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you .  <eos>   she thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual -- a glow both of complexion and spirits .  <eos>   it would be but a new creation , however , and i never think much of your new creations ."  <eos>   what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other !  <eos>   " he wrote a letter to poor mrs . weston , to congratulate her , and a very proper , handsome letter it was .  <eos>   she was the first to announce it to mr . knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more ,) at the conduct of the churchills , in keeping him away .  <eos>   she could not speak another word .-- her voice was lost ; and she sat down , waiting in great terror till harriet should answer .  <eos>   you would have doated on her , had you gone .-- but not a word more .  <eos>   she speaks a little too quick .  <eos>   where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself .  <eos>   mr . elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he exclaimed ,  <eos>   then turning to mrs . weston , with a look of gentle reproach --" ah !  <eos>   part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath ; but bristol was her home , the very heart of bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained -- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived .  <eos>   " you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am ; but still you must , at least i hope you must , think the better of him for it .  <eos>   that is your date .  <eos>   once , i felt the fire rather too much ; but then i moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me .  <eos>   you will tell sir walter what we have done , and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had .  <eos>   they had music ; emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance .  <eos>   for miss ----------, read miss smith .  <eos>   it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds , and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into ; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village , and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived , she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne .  <eos>   how well you put it on !-- so gratified !  <eos>   elton !-- the stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed .  <eos>   elton ?"  <eos>   she endeavoured to be composed , and to be just .  <eos>   i have never been attached to him .  <eos>   she will break it to you better than i can .  <eos>   that is your date .  <eos>   the greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that i am gone when it is necessary ."  <eos>   it was a gentleman ' s carriage , a curricle , but only coming round from the stable - yard to the front door ; somebody must be going away .  <eos>   an ancient family to be so driven away !  <eos>   the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else .  <eos>   however , she is very agreeable , and mrs . bates too , in a different way .  <eos>   she played .  <eos>   " mr . weston do not trifle with me .-- consider how many of my dearest friends are now in brunswick square .  <eos>   he was gone the next moment :-- after another moment ' s pause ,  <eos>   no , i am sure you are a great deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me what i had best do -- no , no , i do not mean that -- as you say , one ' s mind ought to be quite made up -- one should not be hesitating -- it is a very serious thing .-- it will be safer to say ` no ,' perhaps .-- do you think i had better say ` no ?'"  <eos>   louisa was much the same .  <eos>   their first pause was at the crown inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one of the sort , where a couple of pair of post - horses were kept , more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added ; it had been built many years ago for a ball - room , and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous , dancing state , had been occasionally used as such ;-- but such brilliant days had long passed away , and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half - gentlemen of the place .  <eos>   it is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other ."  <eos>   chapter xviii  <eos>   she had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life , and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen ; a wish that they had more pride ; for " our cousins lady dalrymple and miss carteret ;" " our cousins , the dalrymples ," sounded in her ears all day long .  <eos>   " mr . weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject .  <eos>   it was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ), as well as miss smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent -- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and harriet not much otherwise , emma would not interfere with .  <eos>   we may well say that ` our lot is cast in a goodly heritage .'  <eos>   " miss woodhouse ," said frank churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , " have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ?  <eos>   she was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given uppercross its cheerful character .  <eos>   " and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her !  <eos>   and , after proceeding a few steps , she added -- " i stopped you ungraciously , just now , mr . knightley , and , i am afraid , gave you pain .-- but if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me .-- i will hear whatever you like .  <eos>   " mr . weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject .  <eos>   known to have some influence with her sister , she was continually requested , or at least receiving hints to exert it , beyond what was practicable .  <eos>   emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note .  <eos>   i think very well of mr . elton , and this is the only way i have of doing him a service ."  <eos>   i knew that we should either go to the bottom together , or that she would be the making of me ; and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her ; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining , i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn , to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted .  <eos>   i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome ."  <eos>   weston !-- astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman !  <eos>   there is no comparison between them .  <eos>   chapter xi  <eos>   i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person ."  <eos>   she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness .  <eos>   " miss smith !-- message to miss smith !-- what could she possibly mean !"  <eos>   you will soon , i earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself .-- no description can describe her .  <eos>   at the time of the ballroom ' s being built , suppers had not been in question ; and a small card - room adjoining , was the only addition .  <eos>   instances have been known of young people passing many , many months successively , without being at any ball of any description , and no material injury accrue either to body or mind ;-- but when a beginning is made -- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been , though slightly , felt -- it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more .  <eos>   soon afterwards mr . elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs . goddard ' s for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour .  <eos>   emma had done .  <eos>   she will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home .  <eos>   her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour , and a dark bedroom behind , with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance , which there was only one servant in the house to afford , and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath .  <eos>   " poor girl !"  <eos>   serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them .  <eos>   cried jane , with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure --" there would have been no danger .  <eos>   emma ' s sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between mr . knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation .  <eos>   now there would be pleasure in her returning -- every thing would be a pleasure .  <eos>   the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then their own portion .  <eos>   the gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable ;-- but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at south end , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin .  <eos>   " ay , a very bad business indeed .  <eos>   it is mrs . dixon , i dare say .  <eos>   john knightley only was in mute astonishment .-- that a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london , should set off again , and walk half a mile to another man ' s house , for the sake of being in mixed company till bed - time , of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers , was a circumstance to strike him deeply .  <eos>   do you think he had the elliot countenance ?  <eos>   this , however , was a profound secret , not to be breathed beyond their own circle .  <eos>   some people were always cross when they were hot .  <eos>   emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriet ' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of mr . elton ' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriet ' s side , as there could be any occasion for .  <eos>   the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle - tattle of highbury yet .  <eos>   excepting yourself and your brother , i do not know his equal for temper .  <eos>   perry tells me that mr . cole never touches malt liquor .  <eos>   she tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all .  <eos>   it will not be so great a loss of time : but if you dislike it --"  <eos>   it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage .  <eos>   the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma , in a note from mrs . weston , instantly .  <eos>   mr . weston -- ( laughing affectedly ) i must protest against that .-- a most dangerous precedent indeed !-- i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example .-- upon my word , if this is what i am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves !-- oh !  <eos>   very happy to hear it .  <eos>   " how i could so long a time be fancying myself !  <eos>   i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs . goddard .  <eos>   or a mermaid ?  <eos>   with great indignation did he continue to observe him ; with great alarm and distrust , to observe also his two blinded companions .  <eos>   it was a bad business .  <eos>   with the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do i mention miss woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think i ought to add , with the deepest humiliation .-- a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to .-- my behaviour to miss woodhouse indicated , i believe , more than it ought .-- in order to assist a concealment so essential to me , i was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown .-- i cannot deny that miss woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but i am sure you will believe the declaration , that had i not been convinced of her indifference , i would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on .-- amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish .-- she received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured playfulness , which exactly suited me .  <eos>   he will be able to tell her how we all are ."  <eos>   she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy .  <eos>   poor mr . woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again .  <eos>   if she could not have been angry with frank churchill too , it would have been dreadful .-- as for jane fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account .  <eos>   no -- pray let her have time to look about her ."  <eos>   and so forth -- i always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see .  <eos>   after a moment ' s pause , captain wentworth said --  <eos>   quite wonderful how she does her hair !-- no hairdresser from london i think could .-- ah !  <eos>   they had not been long seated and composed when mr . woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter ' s attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last .  <eos>   she was not obliged to hear .  <eos>   in all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and mr . knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards mr . elton , if not towards william larkins .  <eos>   _she_ disapproved them , which ought to have been enough .-- my plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient .-- she was displeased ; i thought unreasonably so : i thought her , on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious : i thought her even cold .  <eos>   you may depend upon it , that they will move in the first set in bath this winter , and as rank is rank , your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family ( our family let me say ) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for ."  <eos>   we do not call bermuda or bahama , you know , the west indies ."  <eos>   sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house .  <eos>   mr . elton and i are very good friends , and nothing more ;" and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel .  <eos>   chapter ii  <eos>   the first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of jane fairfax .  <eos>   jemima is so careful ; and she could send us word every hour how he was .  <eos>   as the blow was given , emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell .  <eos>   my mother is so delighted !-- for she is to be three months with us at least .  <eos>   what !  <eos>   at last , it became necessary to speak of her .  <eos>   after waiting another moment --  <eos>   there is no hurry at all .  <eos>   i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend .  <eos>   " you cannot see too much perfection in mrs . weston for my feelings ," said emma ; " were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ , i should listen with pleasure ; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words .  <eos>   " do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of ?-- what do you deserve ?"  <eos>   he does not read ?"  <eos>   " might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it !  <eos>   " i wish ," said henrietta , very well pleased with her companion , " i wish lady russell lived at uppercross , and were intimate with dr shirley .  <eos>   excellent fellow .  <eos>   " walter ," said she , " get down this moment .  <eos>   then , if you please , you shall send it all to mrs . goddard ' s -- i do not know -- no , i think , miss woodhouse , i may just as well have it sent to hartfield , and take it home with me at night .  <eos>   this was very proper ; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable ; but it should have lasted longer .  <eos>   " but i am very much , and without being at all ashamed of it .  <eos>   he is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering jane fairfax ' s ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him ;-- and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr . knightley .  <eos>   ), they happened to say , that her brother , captain wentworth , is just returned to england , or paid off , or something , and is coming to see them almost directly ; and most unluckily it came into mamma ' s head , when they were gone , that wentworth , or something very like it , was the name of poor richard ' s captain at one time ; i do not know when or where , but a great while before he died , poor fellow !  <eos>   picture to yourselves my amazement ; i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin .  <eos>   he seemed not merely happy with her , but proud .  <eos>   we talked it all over with mr . weston last night .  <eos>   it has been completely unexpected .  <eos>   he was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered .  <eos>   " yes ," said mr . john knightley presently , with some slyness , " he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you ."  <eos>   i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell ."  <eos>   emma could not help laughing as she answered , " upon my word , i believe you know her quite as well as i do .-- but , mr . knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him .  <eos>   although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , mr . and mrs . weston ' s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune .  <eos>   in respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are .  <eos>   she had no difficulty in procuring isabella ' s invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention .-- there was a tooth amiss .  <eos>   in one point she was fully justified .  <eos>   you are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life .  <eos>   .  <eos>   knightley ?-- who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him ?-- who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him ?-- would not he like to have him always on the spot ?-- yes .  <eos>   events of every description , changes , alienations , removals -- all , all must be comprised in it , and oblivion of the past -- how natural , how certain too !  <eos>   he told me every thing ; his circumstances and plans , and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage .  <eos>   she has not the least idea ."  <eos>   their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after .  <eos>   mr . weston seems an excellent creature -- quite a first - rate favourite with me already , i assure you .  <eos>   he was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father ' s house , only two miles from uppercross .  <eos>   i should have visited admiral croft , however , at any rate .  <eos>   the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and mr . woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor isabella ;-- which poor isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness .  <eos>   like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her .  <eos>   dear mrs . weston !  <eos>   emma ' s eyes were instantly withdrawn ; and she sat silently meditating , in a fixed attitude , for a few minutes .  <eos>   i think your manners to him encouraging .  <eos>   my dearest anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life !"  <eos>   now , however , it was absolutely to be ; every preparation was resumed , and very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond , a few lines from frank , to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change , and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty - four hours at any given time , induced them to name as early a day as possible .  <eos>   he seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her .  <eos>   the great mrs . churchill was no more .  <eos>   weston ?-- judge between us .  <eos>   and yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will .  <eos>   mr . perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could ."  <eos>   it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due , and she must doubly feel the omission .  <eos>   but she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ?  <eos>   mr . elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harriet ' s head .  <eos>   i have not nerves for the sort of thing ."  <eos>   those were pleasant days when i had the laconia !  <eos>   but if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly i had better not visit her , if i can help it ."  <eos>   leave all that to me .  <eos>
