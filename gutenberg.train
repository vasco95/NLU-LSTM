  she had been the only one of the set absent , for sir walter and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship ' s service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot ; and mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early , and lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her .  <eos>   " my mother ' s deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all .  <eos>   " you are right .  <eos>   what can you possibly have to do ?"  <eos>   said emma in a whisper .  <eos>   " we thought you were to bring them ."  <eos>   peculiarly lucky !-- for as to any real knowledge of a person ' s disposition that bath , or any public place , can give -- it is all nothing ; there can be no knowledge .  <eos>   i have not seen him since seven o ' clock .  <eos>   well , that must be infinitely provoking !  <eos>   granted ;-- for private enjoyment ; and for private enjoyment keep them .  <eos>   mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite , and on the present occasion , receiving her in that house , there was particular attention .  <eos>   chapter ii  <eos>   do not run away with such an idea ."  <eos>   there i was quite right .  <eos>   if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax !"  <eos>   " pray , mr . knightley ," said emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , " how do you know that mr . martin did not speak yesterday ?"  <eos>   that he was a sensible man , an agreeable man , that he talked well , professed good opinions , seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle , this was all clear enough .  <eos>   she liked his open manners , but a little less of open - heartedness would have made him a higher character .-- general benevolence , but not general friendship , made a man what he ought to be .-- she could fancy such a man .  <eos>   i think they judge wisely .  <eos>   no "-- and emma could just catch the words , " so superior to mr .  <eos>   miss bates and miss fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and mrs . elton seemed to think it as much her duty as mrs . weston ' s to receive them .  <eos>   and so you must judge for yourself , whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not ."  <eos>   miss hamilton , now mrs smith , had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable .  <eos>   encouragement should be given .  <eos>   her heart was in a glow , and she feared her face might be as hot .  <eos>   early , i know , you had none ."  <eos>   it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to mr . knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them ,--  <eos>   such was jane fairfax ' s history .  <eos>   i am glad i was not a week later then ."  <eos>   where could have been the attraction ?  <eos>   he paused a moment , again smiling , with his eyes fixed on her face .  <eos>   bates ?"  <eos>   she must not appear to think it a misfortune .-- with all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and mr . knightley meant to marry ; by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person ' s company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and mrs . weston , best in the world .  <eos>   .  <eos>   i like her the better for it .  <eos>   they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival .  <eos>   give me the paper and listen .  <eos>   it was done however .  <eos>   time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr . elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriet ' s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of mr . elton ' s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them .  <eos>   under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , i know you have the warmest heart .  <eos>   he had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery .  <eos>   this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but i do not know that i expect it will ; i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man -- i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy .-- his feelings are warm , but i can imagine them rather changeable .-- every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved .-- i shall do very well again after a little while -- and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and i shall have been let off easily ."  <eos>   " did you see her often at weymouth ?  <eos>   he lived about a mile from highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london .  <eos>   but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way ;-- and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ?"  <eos>   " so i remember to have heard .  <eos>   i hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a weston in merit , and a churchill in fortune .-- but harriet smith -- i have not half done about harriet smith .  <eos>   she could have said more on the subject ; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the crofts , and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants , felt the parish to be so sure of a good example , and the poor of the best attention and relief , that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal , she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay , and that kellynch hall had passed into better hands than its owners '.  <eos>   harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at mrs . goddard ' s ; mr . elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth .  <eos>   she knew who had been frequenting uppercross .  <eos>   " yes , certainly it does .  <eos>   twelve years were gone since they had parted , and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined .  <eos>   could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance !-- but of that , unfortunately , there could be no chance .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   in one moment such a change !  <eos>   do you think i am right ?"  <eos>   some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs . weston ' s drawing - room ;-- mr . elton must compose his joyous looks , and mr . john knightley disperse his ill - humour .  <eos>   " my dear anne ,-- i make no apology for my silence , because i know how little people think of letters in such a place as bath .  <eos>   the evening was quiet and conversable , as mr . woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two mr . knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and emma only occasionally joining in one or the other .  <eos>   a sick child is always the mother ' s property : her own feelings generally make it so ."  <eos>   have you thought , my dear , where you shall put her -- and what room there will be for the children ?"  <eos>   continued mrs musgrove ; " he was grown so steady , and such an excellent correspondent , while he was under your care !  <eos>   emma had never been to box hill ; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing , and she and mr . weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither .  <eos>   do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it ."  <eos>   " she should always send for perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment .  <eos>   there is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere .-- she is _not_ to be with the _dixons_ .  <eos>   " i think she must be here soon ," said he .  <eos>   but i thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned .  <eos>   emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr . knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked .  <eos>   ` full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ` and waste its fragrance on the desert air .'  <eos>   many circumstances assisted the temptation .  <eos>   and so much was said in this way , that anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy , and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once .  <eos>   he walked off to find his father , but was quickly back again with both mr . and mrs . weston .  <eos>   but in this case , anne had left nothing for advice to do ; and though lady russell , as satisfied as ever with her own discretion , never wished the past undone , she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for anne ' s being tempted , by some man of talents and independence , to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits .  <eos>   by doing it , i shall feel that i am near you .  <eos>   " for shame , emma !  <eos>   elton !"  <eos>   " yes -- rather -- i have been thinking of it some little time ."  <eos>   his manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told anne , almost ready to exclaim , " can this be mr elliot ?"  <eos>   it was soon drawn , perforce another way .  <eos>   elton ?"  <eos>   while waiting for the carriage , she found mr . knightley by her side .  <eos>   they would be very much pleased ."  <eos>   she had never been quite well since the time of their daughter ' s marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort .  <eos>   i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour .  <eos>   emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own .  <eos>   said emma , as soon as she could speak .  <eos>   but not a bit did walter stir .  <eos>   she had little difficulty ; it was soon determined that they would go ; go to - morrow , fix themselves at the inn , or get into lodgings , as it suited , and there remain till dear louisa could be moved .  <eos>   and so late !  <eos>   mrs harville , a degree less polished than her husband , seemed , however , to have the same good feelings ; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own , because the friends of captain wentworth , or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them .  <eos>   she was a widow and poor .  <eos>   i told you that your suspicions would guide mine ."  <eos>   every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr . elton , was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage .  <eos>   yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it .  <eos>   she replied with a smile of astonishment , " are you imagining me to be mr . elton ' s object ?"  <eos>   neither more nor less than his being in love with louisa , and not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer from mr musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by captain harville .  <eos>   " not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates ?  <eos>   emma and harriet were going to walk ; he joined them ; and , on returning , they fell in with a larger party , who , like themselves , judged it wisest to take their exercise early , as the weather threatened rain ; mr . and mrs . weston and their son , miss bates and her niece , who had accidentally met .  <eos>   chapter v  <eos>   chapter i  <eos>   shark is only one syllable .  <eos>   i hope whenever poor isabella ' s little ones have the measles , she will send for perry ."  <eos>   i had imagined him , i confess , a degree or two nearer gentility ."  <eos>   dear emma has been to call on mrs . and miss bates , mr . knightley , as i told you before .  <eos>   he was astonished , indeed , but his character and general conduct must refute it .  <eos>   always my kindest friend on every occasion .  <eos>   mrs . weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied .  <eos>   she drew up plans of economy , she made exact calculations , and she did what nobody else thought of doing : she consulted anne , who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question .  <eos>   but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling -- there was one person , i think , who must have felt it : miss fairfax herself .  <eos>   the portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment .  <eos>   she spoke , and seemed only to offend .  <eos>   at the same time , i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware .  <eos>   find some body for me .  <eos>   he thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it .  <eos>   he will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss ."  <eos>   do let me hear what she says .'"  <eos>   i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .  <eos>   their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance .  <eos>   well , i shall bring jane with me -- jane and her aunt .-- the rest i leave to you .  <eos>   i wish you may not catch cold ."  <eos>   he cut her short with ,  <eos>   " these matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them .  <eos>   " yes -- i _have_ called there ; passing the door , i thought it better .  <eos>   he was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about jane ' s age : and jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .  <eos>   it was through a series of strange blunders !"  <eos>   it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church .  <eos>   " yes , indeed , a very good letter ," replied emma rather slowly --" so good a letter , harriet , that every thing considered , i think one of his sisters must have helped him .  <eos>   mrs charles quite swears by her , i know ; but i just give you this hint , that you may be upon the watch ; because , if you see anything amiss , you need not be afraid of mentioning it ."  <eos>   mrs . weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem .  <eos>   can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me ?-- absurd and insufferable !"  <eos>   mr . weston , however , too eager to be very observant , too communicative to want others to talk , was very well satisfied with what she did say , and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already .  <eos>   while she remained , a bush of low rambling holly protected her , and they were moving on .  <eos>   emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful .  <eos>   " i have no conception whom you can mean , shepherd ; i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent ."  <eos>   that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here .  <eos>   but it should be so no more .  <eos>   this , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road .-- so frank writes word .  <eos>   it will be giving him so much pleasure !  <eos>   a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings .  <eos>   her usefulness to little charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months ' visit there , but he was gaining strength apace , and she had nothing else to stay for .  <eos>   when he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind .  <eos>   " let me entreat you ," cried mr . elton ; " it would indeed be a delight !  <eos>   the truth is , harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but jane fairfax ' s is much beyond it ."  <eos>   leave all that to me .  <eos>   how else could they come ?"  <eos>   a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise -- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards .  <eos>   she was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given uppercross its cheerful character .  <eos>   i told you he was plain ."  <eos>   he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips .  <eos>   i shall leave off while i am well ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment .  <eos>   " break it to me ," cried emma , standing still with terror .-- " good god !-- mr .  <eos>   little things do not irritate him .  <eos>   it will be the only difference ."  <eos>   the invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like mrs . elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves .-- emma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and mr . weston , unasked , promised to get frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with .-- mr . knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and mr . weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come .  <eos>   at this moment whom are you thinking of ?"  <eos>   he looked , as he spoke , to the seat which mrs clay had been lately occupying : a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant ; and though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride , she was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay ; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father ' s getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her .  <eos>   " encouragement !-- i give you encouragement !-- sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it .  <eos>   " no ; not immediately here .  <eos>   she was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing - room , the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby , under the influence of four summers and two children ; and , on anne ' s appearing , greeted her with --  <eos>   " nonsense , errant nonsense , as ever was talked !"  <eos>   emma saw how mr . weston understood these joyous prospects .  <eos>   -- and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness ,  <eos>   a man must be very much in love , indeed , to describe her so .  <eos>   " how very pleasing and proper of him !"  <eos>   mr and mrs musgrove took me , and we were so crowded !  <eos>   " mr . knightley ," said emma , trying to be lively , but really confused -- " i am in a very extraordinary situation .  <eos>   yes , i must be there ; i could not refuse ; and i will keep as much awake as i can ; but i would rather be at home , looking over william larkins ' s week ' s account ; much rather , i confess .-- pleasure in seeing dancing !-- not i , indeed -- i never look at it -- i do not know who does .-- fine dancing , i believe , like virtue , must be its own reward .  <eos>   then , don ' t speak it , don ' t speak it ," she eagerly cried .  <eos>   " you know ," said she , " i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta ; and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made , she has no right to throw herself away .  <eos>   emma found it really time to be at home ; the visit had already lasted long ; and on examining watches , so much of the morning was perceived to be gone , that mrs . weston and her companion taking leave also , could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates , before they set off for randalls .  <eos>   chapter x  <eos>   but i live out of the world , and am often astonished at what i hear .  <eos>   my dear mrs . weston , do not take to match - making .  <eos>   captain harville , though not equalling captain wentworth in manners , was a perfect gentleman , unaffected , warm , and obliging .  <eos>   the chances are that she must be a gainer ."  <eos>   it seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away .  <eos>   he listened in perfect silence .  <eos>   i really am ashamed of always leading the way ."  <eos>   " we consider our hartfield pork ," replied mr . woodhouse --" indeed it certainly is , so very superior to all other pork , that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than --"  <eos>   and i am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment .  <eos>   " i thought he meant to try his skill , by his manner of declining it yesterday ."  <eos>   there will be a great many people talking at once .  <eos>   " i doubt its being very clever myself ," said mr . weston .  <eos>   he should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet mr . and mrs . elton , and any other of his neighbours .-- he could not see any objection at all to his , and emma ' s , and harriet ' s going there some very fine morning .  <eos>   anne did not share these feelings .  <eos>   mr . frank churchill did not come .  <eos>   " and when ," thought emma , " will there be a beginning of mr .  <eos>   said mrs . weston in a trembling voice .  <eos>   though better endowed than the elder sister , mary had not anne ' s understanding nor temper .  <eos>   he re - urged -- she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it --  <eos>   the waiter came into the room soon afterwards .  <eos>   " i beg your pardon , madam , this is your seat ;" and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative , he was not to be induced to sit down again .  <eos>   she would not be in a hurry to find fault , but she suspected that there was no elegance ;-- ease , but not elegance .-- she was almost sure that for a young woman , a stranger , a bride , there was too much ease .  <eos>   do you think him so very plain ?"  <eos>   harriet was silent .  <eos>   emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented to his proposition of mr . frank churchill and miss smith making their party quite complete .  <eos>   surry is the garden of england ."  <eos>   he knows the value of a good income as well as any body .  <eos>   sir walter wanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond .  <eos>   he was quite as good - looking as he had appeared at lyme , his countenance improved by speaking , and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be , so polished , so easy , so particularly agreeable , that she could compare them in excellence to only one person ' s manners .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot .  <eos>   " no , no ; your room is full enough .  <eos>   we must go in the carriage , to be sure ."  <eos>   " well , well , means to make her an offer then .  <eos>   he did not think we ever walked this road .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   charles musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , anne could believe , with lady russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits .  <eos>   " oh , the difference of situation and habit !  <eos>   he was very much pleased with randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to highbury , highbury itself , hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one ' s _own_ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it .  <eos>   but what shall you do ?  <eos>   they must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , i do not consider it unwholesome ."  <eos>   i never was equal to this ."  <eos>   " ay , true enough ," ( with a deep sigh ) " only june ."  <eos>   she was aware herself , that , parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not have rested , as it now almost wholly did , on isabella ' s letters .  <eos>   mr . wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy -- except when it has been quite an influenza ."  <eos>   there was no time for farther remark or explanation .  <eos>   emma ' s courage returned , and she walked on .  <eos>   here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it .  <eos>   you were kept waiting at the door -- i was quite ashamed -- but somehow there was a little bustle -- for it so happened that we had not heard the knock , and till you were on the stairs , we did not know any body was coming .  <eos>   there must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for ."  <eos>   i am a talker , you know ; i am rather a talker ; and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not .  <eos>   his ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer .  <eos>   " he trifles here ," said he , " as to the temptation .  <eos>   " for when a lady ' s in the case , " you know all other things give place ."  <eos>   " to be sure .  <eos>   he wanted her to look up and smile ; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly -- she did -- cheerfully answering ,  <eos>   " emma , my dear emma --"  <eos>   " ever hear her !"  <eos>   who cried most ?"  <eos>   ` woman , lovely woman .'  <eos>   she did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; i could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _try_ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but i know no more what i said -- i was in such a tremble !-- i remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which i thought almost too kind !  <eos>   now i am secure of you for ever ."  <eos>   you have drawn two pretty pictures ; but i think there may be a third -- a something between the do - nothing and the do - all .  <eos>   you are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , i think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones .  <eos>   charles , anne , must not it ?  <eos>   depend upon it , a man of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself ."  <eos>   you cannot really , seriously , doubt it .  <eos>   but this was not judged feasible .  <eos>   frank churchill turned towards her to listen .  <eos>   " such an eye !-- the true hazle eye -- and so brilliant !  <eos>   he had intended , on first arriving , to proceed very soon into shropshire , and visit the brother settled in that country , but the attractions of uppercross induced him to put this off .  <eos>   what a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave !-- he gave his consent with very little persuasion ."  <eos>   she hoped they might now become friends again .  <eos>   the intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by emma and mr .  <eos>   it would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers .  <eos>   this is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure !  <eos>   the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing - room when mr . weston made his appearance among them .  <eos>   " aye , we men are sad fellows .  <eos>   phoo !"  <eos>   louisa had once opened her eyes , but soon closed them again , without apparent consciousness .  <eos>   my only doubt is , whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish .  <eos>   happy those , who can remain at highbury !"  <eos>   you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest --.  <eos>   i am sure there is nobody ' s praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouse ' s .  <eos>   you do not mean it ?"  <eos>   a gentleman ' s family is all that i should condition for ."  <eos>   four - and - twenty hours later , and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth , in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers ; and being lost in only a sloop , nobody would have thought about me ."  <eos>   we shall not be many , you know ."  <eos>   there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman ' s daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you ."  <eos>   those letters are convenient passports .  <eos>   if she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and i am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- but , miss smith , indeed !-- oh !  <eos>   she was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited mr . woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip .  <eos>   yes , i am sure you are much too reasonable .  <eos>   as for isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr . westons aside as much as she can ."  <eos>   -- here was a sly glance at emma .  <eos>   mrs . weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses , in order to hear the new instrument .  <eos>   emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault .  <eos>   is not that your idea ?"  <eos>   to him who has , it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence , and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought .  <eos>   " we are expecting a brother of mrs croft ' s here soon ; i dare say you know him by name ."  <eos>   " no , certainly not ; i shall go home in the cool of the evening ."  <eos>   she then took a longer time for consideration .  <eos>   the usefulness of her staying !  <eos>   " i do not believe any such thing ," replied emma .--" i am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent .  <eos>   " i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before ."  <eos>   " think of me to - morrow , my dear emma , about four o ' clock ," was mrs . weston ' s parting injunction ; spoken with some anxiety , and meant only for her .  <eos>   that he did not regard it as a desperate case , that he did not say a few hours must end it , was at first felt , beyond the hope of most ; and the ecstasy of such a reprieve , the rejoicing , deep and silent , after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered , may be conceived .  <eos>   nobody had any information to give ; and , after a few more wonderings , emma said ,  <eos>   he was warm in his reprobation of mr . elton ' s conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and mrs . elton ' s looks also received the due share of censure .  <eos>   the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then their own portion .  <eos>   she is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all .  <eos>   upon my word , perry has restored her in a wonderful short time !-- oh !  <eos>   said emma , highly amused .--" mr .  <eos>   well , what do you say to it ?-- i always told you he would be here again soon , did not i ?-- anne , my dear , did not i always tell you so , and you would not believe me ?-- in town next week , you see -- at the latest , i dare say ; for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or saturday .  <eos>   i am not at all equal to it .  <eos>   my dear miss woodhouse -- i come quite over - powered .  <eos>   was not that her own doing too ?  <eos>   _she_ would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners .  <eos>   mr . knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure ;-- not like mr . elton .  <eos>   such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs . elton ' s way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness ."  <eos>   selina is no fine lady , i assure you .  <eos>   harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness -- and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force .  <eos>   lady russell had only to listen composedly , and wish them happy , but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure , in pleased contempt , that the man who at twenty - three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an anne elliot , should , eight years afterwards , be charmed by a louisa musgrove .  <eos>   " is there no one to help me ?"  <eos>   where is your merit ?  <eos>   she promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it .  <eos>   he was not an ill - tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased .  <eos>   i mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative ."  <eos>   " i hope not _that_ .-- it is not likely .  <eos>   anne understood it .  <eos>   for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself .  <eos>   to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object -- if one could but tell what that would be ."  <eos>   he has a great regard for the bateses , you know , independent of jane fairfax -- and is always glad to shew them attention .  <eos>   emma ' s courage returned , and she walked on .  <eos>   she is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly .  <eos>   i went in for three minutes , and was detained by miss bates ' s being absent .  <eos>   miss woodhouse , how kind you are !-- i suppose you have heard -- and are come to give us joy .  <eos>   fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry , and miss jane bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl .  <eos>   how is mr .  <eos>   " good or bad ?"  <eos>   mrs . weston ' s communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax .  <eos>   poor miss taylor !  <eos>   it is not that i am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should put - to for such a purpose ."  <eos>   he had returned to a late dinner , and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over .  <eos>   mr . perry has been with her , as you probably heard ."  <eos>   i wish you may not catch cold ."  <eos>   no , there is but one .  <eos>   knightley ' s words dwelt with her .  <eos>   you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music .  <eos>   emma longed to know what frank ' s first opinion of mrs . elton might be ; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress , and her smiles of graciousness .  <eos>   there was some anxiety mixed with lady russell ' s joy in meeting her .  <eos>   she speaks a little too quick .  <eos>   mrs . hodges may well be angry .  <eos>   or miss bates ?  <eos>   the change on mrs . elton ' s side soon afterwards appeared , and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of mrs . elton , nor , under mrs . elton ' s guidance , the very active patroness of jane fairfax , and only sharing with others in a general way , in knowing what was felt , what was meditated , what was done .  <eos>   he considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy ; and the sir walter elliot , who united these gifts , was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion .  <eos>   compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent .  <eos>   " as you do us such ample justice now ," said emma , laughing , " i will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ?  <eos>   cole ."  <eos>   but for harriet ' s sake , or rather for my own , and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_ , i will break my resolution now ."  <eos>   it had not been possible for him to spend less ; he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot was imperiously called on to do ; but blameless as he was , he was not only growing dreadfully in debt , but was hearing of it so often , that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer , even partially , from his daughter .  <eos>   mr . weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to mrs . weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room .  <eos>   remember ."  <eos>   i undertake the commission .  <eos>   no , indeed ; i must protest against any such idea .  <eos>   " sir henry russell ' s widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot .  <eos>   we never see any thing of it on our club - nights ."  <eos>   upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours , he was quite indignant .  <eos>   he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing .  <eos>   if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now , it might augur something .  <eos>   " only think of our happening to meet him !-- how very odd !  <eos>   and in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and emma was quite in charity with him .  <eos>   ` my dear ,' said i , ` i shall say you are laid down upon the bed :' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room .  <eos>   it was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty ; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection .  <eos>   what can you possibly have to do ?"  <eos>   strangers filling their place !"  <eos>   mr . elton must now be left to himself .  <eos>   " very well ," replied emma ; " a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better i shall be pleased .  <eos>   leave all that to me .  <eos>   i have no thoughts of matrimony at present ."  <eos>   i like them extremely .  <eos>   " one would rather have a stranger preferred than one ' s very particular friend -- with a stranger it might not recur again -- but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself !-- poor mrs . dixon !  <eos>   with all her reasoning , she found , that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing .  <eos>   " no , but it did not absolutely rain when i set out ."  <eos>   " both sir !  <eos>   after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr . and mrs . suckling , the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn .  <eos>   " she is a riddle , quite a riddle !"  <eos>   " i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls ."  <eos>   hers is a line for seeing human nature ; and she has a fund of good sense and observation , which , as a companion , make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received ` the best education in the world ,' know nothing worth attending to .  <eos>   and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one ; her judgement , on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against mr elliot .  <eos>   he will connect himself well if he can ."  <eos>   it was short , but expressed good sense , warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy of feeling .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse was fond of society in his own way .  <eos>   .  <eos>   now , mr . knightley , a word or two more , and i have done .  <eos>   what a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure !  <eos>   no , these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures ; her spirits rose under their influence ; and like mrs musgrove , she was feeling , though not saying , that after being long in the country , nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness .  <eos>   i always fetch the letters when i am here .  <eos>   " a sore - throat !-- i hope not infectious .  <eos>   to know that _she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy .  <eos>   lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , and woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .  <eos>   " your command ?-- yes ."  <eos>   latterly , however -- for some time , indeed -- i have had no idea of their meaning any thing .-- i thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side .  <eos>   a great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure i had to persuade away .  <eos>   anne , i am so very unwell !  <eos>   not that she _wanted_ him to marry .  <eos>   " i might not like them the better for that perhaps .  <eos>   " ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell ' s , i made up my mind on the subject .  <eos>   with all the eagerness which such a transition gives , emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible .  <eos>   i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting frank .  <eos>   " i can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under mrs . weston ' s care .  <eos>   he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged miss fairfax , who was still sitting at it , to play something more .  <eos>   they were soon dining in company together at mr musgrove ' s , for the little boy ' s state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself ; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings .  <eos>   he considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily , uniting very strong feelings with quiet , serious , and retiring manners , and a decided taste for reading , and sedentary pursuits .  <eos>   miss bates looked about her , so happily !--  <eos>   she boldly acknowledged herself flattered , and continued her enquiries .  <eos>   " i cannot agree with you .  <eos>   captain weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill , of a great yorkshire family , and miss churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend .  <eos>   " what is the matter ?"  <eos>   " there !  <eos>   " my mother ' s deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all .  <eos>   said emma , highly amused .--" mr .  <eos>   it was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction .-- till yesterday , i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans .  <eos>   mrs . weston remained with mr . woodhouse .  <eos>   he looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused ; said something about " honour ,"-- glanced at emma and at harriet , and then seeing the book open on the table , took it up , and examined it very attentively .  <eos>   i have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her , while i go in and break it to mr and mrs musgrove .  <eos>   knightley .--" emma , that i fear is a word -- no , i have no wish -- stay , yes , why should i hesitate ?-- i have gone too far already for concealment .-- emma , i accept your offer -- extraordinary as it may seem , i accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend .-- tell me , then , have i no chance of ever succeeding ?"  <eos>   her own conduct , as well as her own heart , was before her in the same few minutes .  <eos>   " i have no doubt of it ."  <eos>   _he_ had done it .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   i think we do want a larger council .  <eos>   tell your aunt , little emma , that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances , and that if she were not wrong before , she is now ."  <eos>   my courage rises while i write .  <eos>   herself the widow of only a knight , she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due ; and sir walter , independent of his claims as an old acquaintance , an attentive neighbour , an obliging landlord , the husband of her very dear friend , the father of anne and her sisters , was , as being sir walter , in her apprehension , entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties .  <eos>   " my dear anne ,-- i make no apology for my silence , because i know how little people think of letters in such a place as bath .  <eos>   " for when a lady ' s in the case , " you know all other things give place ."  <eos>   " do you think so ?"  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   it was a fine family - piece .  <eos>   the horror of the moment to all who stood around !  <eos>   " it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined !  <eos>   " one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , harriet .  <eos>   as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty .  <eos>   she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   mr . elton , in very good spirits , was one of the first to walk in .  <eos>   knightley .'  <eos>   but , i assure you , i have never been in the house above twice in my life ."  <eos>   the danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .  <eos>   " upon my word it is , miss bates .-- he really is engaged from morning to night .-- there is no end of people ' s coming to him , on some pretence or other .-- the magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion .  <eos>   she has plenty of money , and i intend she shall buy all the high - priced things i have in hand now ."  <eos>   she understood him .  <eos>   between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters .  <eos>   compare mr . martin with either of _them_ .  <eos>   your interest , sir walter , is in pretty safe hands .  <eos>   he sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes ; and when rousing himself , it was only to say ,  <eos>   she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   elton ."  <eos>   it was a sad change .  <eos>   so far off !-- and the air so bad !"  <eos>   emma said it would be awkward ; mrs . weston was in distress about the supper ; and mr . woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health .  <eos>   no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern ; it was the language of real feeling towards mrs . weston ; and the transition from highbury to enscombe , the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt , and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety .-- the charm of her own name was not wanting .  <eos>   i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home ."  <eos>   emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr . weston depended , and felt , that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity .  <eos>   if it can be contrived to be at the crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses .  <eos>   i never could have an idea of any body else -- and so i thought you knew .  <eos>   i am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting mr . and mrs . cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish .  <eos>   if _we_ exert ourselves , i think we shall not be long in want of allies .  <eos>   " but they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much .  <eos>   " and if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again ."  <eos>   how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ?  <eos>   " ever hear her !"  <eos>   jane desired me to do it , so i always do : and so i began to - day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell , than i burst out , quite frightened , with ` bless me !  <eos>   waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice .  <eos>   thought emma .  <eos>   mr . knightley does nothing mysteriously ."  <eos>   they will read together .  <eos>   " mary is good - natured enough in many respects ," said she ; " but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride -- the elliot pride .  <eos>   how much worse , had they been obliged to meet !  <eos>   replied mrs . weston , smiling , " what is the certainty of caprice ?"  <eos>   there the news must follow him , but who was to tell it ?  <eos>   but i ought to have gone before .  <eos>   he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout , and mrs croft seemed to go shares with him in everything , and to walk for her life to do him good .  <eos>   i have spent so many happy months there !  <eos>   a glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate .  <eos>   you can slip in from the shrubbery at any time ; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door .  <eos>   his eldest daughter ' s alarm was equal to his own .  <eos>   " upon my word ," she cried , " the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking .  <eos>   as a counsellor she was not wanted ; but as an approver , ( a much safer character ,) she was truly welcome .  <eos>   the appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of mrs . elton to have _her_ carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure .  <eos>   and you can be always with me .  <eos>   -- those were miss woodhouse ' s words , were they ?-- and a fine ending -- and there is the letter .  <eos>   but what is distance , mr . weston , to people of large fortune ?-- you would be amazed to hear how my brother , mr . suckling , sometimes flies about .  <eos>   he re - urged -- she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it --  <eos>   on quitting the cobb , they all went in - doors with their new friends , and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many .  <eos>   " my dear papa , he is three - and - twenty .  <eos>   jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold .  <eos>   " that will never be , however , i can assure you .  <eos>   i have always been blessed with excellent health , and no climate disagrees with me .  <eos>   the visit of ceremony was paid and returned ; and louisa musgrove was mentioned , and captain benwick , too , without even half a smile .  <eos>   the horror of the moment to all who stood around !  <eos>   but here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him .  <eos>   she wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like frank churchill better .-- he seemed often observing her .  <eos>   anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger , that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister .  <eos>   i am rather proud of little george .  <eos>   i am sorry mr . and mrs . cole should have done it .  <eos>   ambition , as well as love , had probably been mortified .  <eos>   on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; jane would hardly eat any thing :-- mr . perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful .  <eos>   no one had ever come within the kellynch circle , who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth , as he stood in her memory .  <eos>   what !-- engaged to her all the winter -- before either of them came to highbury ?"  <eos>   he was invited on good faith .  <eos>   " from something that he said , my dear emma , i rather imagine --"  <eos>   now , here will be mr . elton and miss hawkins ; and there are the coles , such very good people ; and the perrys -- i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr . and mrs . perry .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   of what sort ?"  <eos>   he was astonished , indeed , but his character and general conduct must refute it .  <eos>   it was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married .  <eos>   it is such a pretty charade , my dear , that i can easily guess what fairy brought it .-- nobody could have written so prettily , but you , emma ."  <eos>   in half a minute they were together .  <eos>   well , and how did mr . churchill take it ?"  <eos>   seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment , and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving ; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency .  <eos>   " that may be , and i may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name .  <eos>   do you think lady russell would like that ?"  <eos>   " you forget how much she belongs to highbury .  <eos>   those dear little children .  <eos>   they are not at all the less written you know , because you divide them .  <eos>   the conclusion of her visit , however , was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined .  <eos>   it will be the only difference ."  <eos>   jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off .  <eos>   you cannot really , seriously , doubt it .  <eos>   do not beat me ."  <eos>   harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances .-- emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation .  <eos>   my dear emma , we must consider this .  <eos>   weston ?-- to bath , or to clifton ?"  <eos>   i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau ."  <eos>   " i am afraid jane is not very well ," said she , " but i do not know ; they _tell_ me she is well .  <eos>   emma ' s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed ,-- aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion : but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible .  <eos>   " if it were admissible to contradict a lady ," said the gallant mr . elton --  <eos>   what dreadful weather we have had !  <eos>   well , and how did mr . churchill take it ?"  <eos>   " true , true ," he answered , warmly .  <eos>   " no , nothing ."  <eos>   mr . woodhouse ' s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill - bestowed .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse told me of it .  <eos>   harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins , was less and less at hartfield ; which was not to be regretted .-- the intimacy between her and emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner .  <eos>   she wished him very well ; but he gave her pain , and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction .  <eos>   " encouragement !-- i give you encouragement !-- sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it .  <eos>   emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour .  <eos>   " well , miss woodhouse !"  <eos>   my poor mother does not know how to bear it .  <eos>   the party was to be our brother and sister , henry , john -- and miss smith .  <eos>   " i say nothing of which i am ashamed ," replied he , with lively impudence .  <eos>   her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with .  <eos>   thy ready wit the word will soon supply .  <eos>   a few awkward moments passed , and he sat down again ; and in a more determined manner said ,  <eos>   she loved every body , was interested in every body ' s happiness , quicksighted to every body ' s merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature , and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother , and so many good neighbours and friends , and a home that wanted for nothing .  <eos>   where miss taylor failed to stimulate , i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothing .-- you never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished .-- you know you could not ."  <eos>   concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt ' s arms .  <eos>   she gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme .  <eos>   it was badly done , indeed !  <eos>   " news !  <eos>   " a man cannot be more so ," was his short , full answer .  <eos>   i have not always known their writing apart ."  <eos>   " will mr . frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford ?"  <eos>   " you are right , mrs . weston ," said mr . knightley warmly , " miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs . elton .  <eos>   i dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so i say one thing and then i say another , and it passes off .  <eos>   do you know how miss bates and her niece came here ?"  <eos>   he paused -- and growing cooler in a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , " if mr . perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty , i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself ."  <eos>   you can send for us , you know , at a moment ' s notice , if anything is the matter ; but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you .  <eos>   she could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable .  <eos>   i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together .  <eos>   but hush , hush !"  <eos>   with all the state which a butler and foot - boy could give , mr elliot was ushered into the room .  <eos>   the confession completely renewed her first shame -- and the sight of harriet ' s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again .  <eos>   she left it to himself to recollect , that mrs smith was not the only widow in bath between thirty and forty , with little to live on , and no surname of dignity .  <eos>   such scarecrows as the streets were full of !  <eos>   henrietta was perhaps the prettiest , louisa had the higher spirits ; and she knew not now , whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest .-- to emma ' s entreaties and assurances succeeded mr . knightley ' s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion .-- they had all the assistance which isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and mrs . weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr . woodhouse ' s mind .-- it was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place .  <eos>   miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells , or they would have been guessed at first .  <eos>   very odd !  <eos>   but you really frightened me .  <eos>   lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once , when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again .  <eos>   i must order the carriage .  <eos>   " yes ; you see his papa can , and why should not i ?  <eos>   frank churchill came back again ; and if he kept his father ' s dinner waiting , it was not known at hartfield ; for mrs . weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr . woodhouse , to betray any imperfection which could be concealed .  <eos>   i should have visited admiral croft , however , at any rate .  <eos>   isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before .-- isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   do not you , anne ?  <eos>   the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   he could ride to london at any time .  <eos>   this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and mr . knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said ,  <eos>   harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful .  <eos>   mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite , and on the present occasion , receiving her in that house , there was particular attention .  <eos>   the great mrs . churchill was no more .  <eos>   such an aunt !"  <eos>   the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to mr . cole .  <eos>   her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could mr . knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove .  <eos>   mr . elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harriet ' s head .  <eos>   " my dear papa , i sent the whole hind - quarter .  <eos>   " where is the young man ?"  <eos>   anne heard her , and made no violent exclamations ; she only smiled , blushed , and gently shook her head .  <eos>   a man at his age -- what is he ?-- three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that .  <eos>   my mother is delightfully well ; and jane caught no cold last night .  <eos>   there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject .  <eos>   i have often known it done myself ."  <eos>   woodhouse , who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined even by him , stirred no more ; and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that mrs . weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need .  <eos>   i thought i had seen you first in february ."  <eos>   even then , i was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but i was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and i went away determined that she should make the first advances .-- i shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party .  <eos>   her countenance , perhaps , might express some watchfulness ; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister .  <eos>   the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day .  <eos>   he came to the abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it .  <eos>   louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to henrietta , mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to captain wentworth --  <eos>   the same civilities and courtesies , the same success and satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid and happy .  <eos>   i grant you , that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta , and indeed it could not be ; he is the only one that could be possible ; but he is a very good - natured , good sort of a fellow ; and whenever winthrop comes into his hands , he will make a different sort of place of it , and live in a very different sort of way ; and with that property , he will never be a contemptible man -- good , freehold property .  <eos>   dancing with open windows !-- i am sure , neither your father nor mrs . weston ( poor miss taylor that was ) would suffer it ."  <eos>   now was the time for mr . frank churchill to come among them ; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion .  <eos>   but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield .  <eos>   i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury , as they can be to see her .  <eos>   " i am not at all surprized at you , harriet .  <eos>   " might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it !  <eos>   they might chuse to surprize her ."  <eos>   he and his wife had taken their intended drive , and were returning home .  <eos>   i think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him ."  <eos>   " upon my word ," said emma , " i begin to doubt my having any such talent .  <eos>   i have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless i can believe myself fit to be seen ."  <eos>   they were people whom her heart turned to very naturally .  <eos>   he called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , emma was immediately convinced must be his own .  <eos>   she never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us .  <eos>   i never was more surprized -- but it does not make me unhappy , i assure you .-- how -- how has it been possible ?"  <eos>   anne , finding she might decline it , did so , very gratefully .  <eos>   " so i remember to have heard .  <eos>   " he will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drop ' s one ' s scissors , or anything that happens .  <eos>   she must see you ."  <eos>   the kind - hearted , polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty , and made every fair lady welcome and easy .  <eos>   he will find an _addition_ to the society of highbury when he comes again ; that is , if i may presume to call myself an addition .  <eos>   talks of his being going on so well !  <eos>   every comfort of life knocked off !  <eos>   you will not be hysterical again .  <eos>   thought emma , " he would have done as much for harriet ."  <eos>   and i hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long ."  <eos>   elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match .  <eos>   _her_ change was equal .-- this one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or distrust .-- on his side , there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of frank churchill .-- he had been in love with emma , and jealous of frank churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other .  <eos>   many vain solicitudes would be prevented -- many awkwardnesses smoothed by it .  <eos>   " that may be , and i may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name .  <eos>   mr . weston ' s ball was to be a real thing .  <eos>   his civilities to the other ladies must be paid ; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering , and the walk he had had for nothing .  <eos>   for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am , and as i am ."  <eos>   what will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ?  <eos>   she had called on her former governess , and had heard from her of there being an old school - fellow in bath , who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering .  <eos>   " mrs . cole has servants to send .  <eos>   " i always told you she was -- a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence .  <eos>   he had gone beyond the sweep -- some way along the highbury road -- the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep -- in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground ; a very few flakes were falling at present , but the clouds were parting , and there was every appearance of its being soon over .  <eos>   a name that i am so very well acquainted with ; knew the gentleman so well by sight ; seen him a hundred times ; came to consult me once , i remember , about a trespass of one of his neighbours ; farmer ' s man breaking into his orchard ; wall torn down ; apples stolen ; caught in the fact ; and afterwards , contrary to my judgement , submitted to an amicable compromise .  <eos>   here it comes .  <eos>   she had hardly been able to speak a word , and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness .  <eos>   captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove ' s civility , and she was all but calling there in the same half hour .  <eos>   there could not be a doubt , to her mind there was none , of what would follow her recovery .  <eos>   " think of me to - morrow , my dear emma , about four o ' clock ," was mrs . weston ' s parting injunction ; spoken with some anxiety , and meant only for her .  <eos>   you saw her with the campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on .  <eos>   i am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in .-- perhaps i am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation .  <eos>   but now , another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these .  <eos>   the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties .  <eos>   bless me !  <eos>   emma watched them in , and then joined harriet at the interesting counter ,-- trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern .  <eos>   if he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , i dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had .  <eos>   he cut her short with ,  <eos>   emma gave a start , which did not seem like being prepared -- and her eyes , in eager gaze , said , " no , this is impossible !"  <eos>   walk home !-- you are prettily shod for walking home , i dare say .  <eos>   i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue .  <eos>   had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of harriet ' s mind , emma would have been amused by its variations .  <eos>   but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once , and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time .  <eos>   for her own sake she could not be rude ; and for harriet ' s , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of mr . elton ' s nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to .  <eos>   " highbury gossips !-- tiresome wretches !"  <eos>   " heir presumptive , william walter elliot , esq ., great grandson of the second sir walter ."  <eos>   my dear emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point ."  <eos>   " i cannot think there is any danger of it ," was emma ' s calm answer -- " and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax ' s situation and understand what her home has been , with colonel and mrs . campbell , i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown ."  <eos>   his ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer .  <eos>   " well -- if you advise it .-- but ( with a smile ) if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall i say ?  <eos>   the rich brother - in - law near bristol was the pride of the alliance , and his place and his carriages were the pride of him .  <eos>   this very awkward history of mr elliot was still , after an interval of several years , felt with anger by elizabeth , who had liked the man for himself , and still more for being her father ' s heir , and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter elliot ' s eldest daughter .  <eos>   my dear ; but so much as patty has to do !-- and it is a kindness to employ our men ."  <eos>   this was the occurrence :-- the coles had been settled some years in highbury , and were very good sort of people -- friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel .  <eos>   and then not to find him at home !  <eos>   " that ' s easily said , and easily felt by you , who have always been your own master .  <eos>   " thank you ," said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed .  <eos>   mr . knightley , he is _not_ a trifling , silly young man .  <eos>   it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father , and with what she felt for him .  <eos>   yes , i am sure : carry her gently to the inn ."  <eos>   do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing .  <eos>   from our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so .-- whether miss woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , i cannot say ;-- when i called to take leave of her , i remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth , and i then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but i have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree .-- she may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part .  <eos>   that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man , and , moreover , a single man at the time , she had a fond dependence on no human creature ' s having heard of it from him .  <eos>   it is his own idea .  <eos>   you pass it over very handsomely -- but you were perfectly right ."  <eos>   " a great many things , i assure you .  <eos>   in all other respects , her visit began and proceeded very well .  <eos>   he reads the agricultural reports , and some other books that lay in one of the window seats -- but he reads all _them_ to himself .  <eos>   it would only be giving trouble and distress .  <eos>   but charles is so positive !  <eos>   she was good enough for mr . elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for highbury -- handsome enough -- to look plain , probably , by harriet ' s side .  <eos>   she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made , and could not but hope that the gipsy , though she had _told_ no fortune , might be proved to have made harriet ' s .-- about a fortnight after the alarm , they came to a sufficient explanation , and quite undesignedly .  <eos>   " no , no ,"-- he gravely replied .--" don ' t ask me .  <eos>   as yet , you have seen nothing of bath .  <eos>   " my dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me ."  <eos>   " no , i fancy not ," replied mrs . elton , with a most satisfied smile ."  <eos>   " he came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner ."  <eos>   miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr . frank churchill ' s going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence .  <eos>   anne had gone unhappy to school , grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved , feeling her separation from home , and suffering as a girl of fourteen , of strong sensibility and not high spirits , must suffer at such a time ; and miss hamilton , three years older than herself , but still from the want of near relations and a settled home , remaining another year at school , had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery , and could never be remembered with indifference .  <eos>   she should put it off as long as she could ;" but was not easy till she had talked charles into driving her over on an early day , and was in a very animated , comfortable state of imaginary agitation , when she came back .  <eos>   what a blessing , that she never had any children !  <eos>   " my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest ," continued mrs . elton ; " and that will be our time for exploring .  <eos>   he found he could not be useful , and his feelings were too much irritated for talking .  <eos>   " and , upon my word , they have an air of great probability .  <eos>   she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill .  <eos>   it was a palpable display , repeated on every possible occasion .  <eos>   they would hardly come in their chaise , i think , at that season of the year .  <eos>   if it were war now , he would have settled it long ago .  <eos>   she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire -- the extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and that even when days were fixed , and invitations accepted , it was an even chance that mrs . churchill were not in health and spirits for going ; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person ; and that , though he had his separate engagements , it was not without difficulty , without considerable address _at_ _times_ , that he could get away , or introduce an acquaintance for a night .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   in fact , as i have long been convinced , though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn , it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any , who can live in a regular way , in the country , choosing their own hours , following their own pursuits , and living on their own property , without the torment of trying for more ; it is only their lot , i say , to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost : i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young ."  <eos>   " but your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street ."  <eos>   " and that you are very likely to do very soon , i can tell you , ma ' am ," said charles .  <eos>   " but you , yourself , brought mrs harville , her sister , her cousin , and three children , round from portsmouth to plymouth .  <eos>   some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs . weston ' s drawing - room ;-- mr . elton must compose his joyous looks , and mr . john knightley disperse his ill - humour .  <eos>   " who is that gentleman on horseback ?"  <eos>   patty makes an excellent apple - dumpling .  <eos>   they secure an introduction .  <eos>   it ought to be no recommendation to _you_ .  <eos>   every emendation of anne ' s had been on the side of honesty against importance .  <eos>   very sincerely did emma wish to do so ; but it was not immediately in her power .  <eos>   come , and eat my strawberries .  <eos>   i wish i had looked at him more .  <eos>   ` elegance , sweetness , beauty .'  <eos>   of mr .  <eos>   if miss woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home ."  <eos>   " ah !"  <eos>   " yes ," said his brother hesitatingly , " there is a likeness .  <eos>   there is so little real friendship in the world !  <eos>   i never heard any county but surry called so ."  <eos>   -- she could really say nothing .--" you are silent ," he cried , with great animation ; " absolutely silent !  <eos>   " very true , very true .  <eos>   emma thought at least it would turn out so .  <eos>   john knightley looked at him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and said , " i could not have believed it even of _him_ ."  <eos>   one man ' s ways may be as good as another ' s , but we all like our own best .  <eos>   colonel campbell , you know , is quite our angel .  <eos>   " i have heard it asserted ," said john knightley , " that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough .  <eos>   he re - urged -- she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it --  <eos>   " whenever the time may come , it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends -- but i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible -- i mean , as to the character and manners of the family ."  <eos>   " and yet ," said anne to herself , as they now moved forward to meet the party , " he has not , perhaps , a more sorrowing heart than i have .  <eos>   " mrs . cole has servants to send .  <eos>   you must answer it of course -- and speedily ."  <eos>   they are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body ' s hurrying away is no great compliment ; and miss woodhouse ' s doing it would be more thought of than any other person ' s in the room .  <eos>   the idea of becoming what her mother had been ; of having the precious name of " lady elliot " first revived in herself ; of being restored to kellynch , calling it her home again , her home for ever , was a charm which she could not immediately resist .  <eos>   it did not appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support .  <eos>   " upon my word , emma ."  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   it was an alarming change ; and emma was thinking of it one morning , as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her , when mr . knightley came in , and distressing thoughts were put by .  <eos>   referring the education to her seemed to imply it .  <eos>   her fancy was very active .  <eos>   she would not let jane say , ` no ;' for when jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at donwell ,) when jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbell ' s return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told mrs . elton over and over again -- and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind !-- but that good mrs . elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than i did .  <eos>   pray say so , with my compliments .  <eos>   these convictions must unquestionably have their own pain , and severe was its kind ; but they precluded that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again , and returning through the well - known apartments .  <eos>   this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating .  <eos>   " mr . weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject .  <eos>   " so early in life -- at three - and - twenty -- a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill . at three - and - twenty to have drawn such a prize !  <eos>   " not the least in the world .-- did he ever give you any thing ?"  <eos>   it had been a great disappointment to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed , so impatient was he to shew his gratitude , by seeing captain wentworth under his own roof , and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars .  <eos>   " my dearest papa !  <eos>   harriet , she found , had never in her life been within side the vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with mr . elton ' s seeing ready wit in her .  <eos>   his appearance is so much against him , and his manner so bad , that if she ever were disposed to favour him , she is not now .  <eos>   say ` no ,' if it is to be said ."  <eos>   i am sorry mr . and mrs . cole should have done it .  <eos>   mr . knightley had done all in his power for mr . woodhouse ' s entertainment .  <eos>   she still intended him for her friend .  <eos>   have patience with me , i shall soon have done .-- she closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again .-- _she_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_ : _she_ _dissolved_ _it_ .-- this letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt ' s death .  <eos>   " i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man .  <eos>   but i think , my dear , you said you had got it ."  <eos>   emma made as slight a reply as she could ; but it was fully sufficient for mrs . elton , who only wanted to be talking herself .  <eos>   lady russell confessed she had expected something better ; but yet " it was an acquaintance worth having ;" and when anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to mr elliot , he agreed to their being nothing in themselves , but still maintained that , as a family connexion , as good company , as those who would collect good company around them , they had their value .  <eos>   indeed i must say that , much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected , he very far exceeds any thing .  <eos>   though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return .  <eos>   the change on mrs . elton ' s side soon afterwards appeared , and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of mrs . elton , nor , under mrs . elton ' s guidance , the very active patroness of jane fairfax , and only sharing with others in a general way , in knowing what was felt , what was meditated , what was done .  <eos>   she never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong , yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to mrs . weston , and so much in love with miss fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever .  <eos>   a carriage was heard .  <eos>   her mind was quite sick of mr . elton and the martins .  <eos>   i cannot help suspecting him .  <eos>   so began miss bates ; and mr . knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn , for most resolutely and commandingly did he say ,  <eos>   she received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which anne perfectly knew the meaning of .  <eos>   she wished him very well ; but he gave her pain , and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction .  <eos>   " quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all ."  <eos>   she felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again and again , she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept .  <eos>   anne will send for me if anything is the matter ."  <eos>   the remaining five were left to their own powers , and emma doubted their getting on very well ; for mr . knightley seemed little disposed for conversation ; mrs . elton was wanting notice , which nobody had inclination to pay , and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent .  <eos>   by doing it , i shall feel that i am near you .  <eos>   well , and how did mr . churchill take it ?"  <eos>   what is right to be done cannot be done too soon .  <eos>   " it would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield ."  <eos>   that was the kind action ; that was the noble benevolence and generosity ; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth ."  <eos>   emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement , and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends -- for the house was taken for may and june .  <eos>   something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know -- there is a sad story against them , in general .  <eos>   " and how did you think miss fairfax looking ?"  <eos>   well , i shall bring jane with me -- jane and her aunt .-- the rest i leave to you .  <eos>   or a mermaid ?  <eos>   my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us .  <eos>   chapter xviii  <eos>   " him !-- never , never .  <eos>   be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible ."  <eos>   she could imagine what louisa was feeling .  <eos>   indeed i must say that , much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected , he very far exceeds any thing .  <eos>   but here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him .  <eos>   she was quite convinced of mr . elton ' s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already .  <eos>   of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines ."  <eos>   mr elliot was better to look at than most men , and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere ."  <eos>   he had not time to enter into much explanation .  <eos>   but from one cause or another , i gave it up in disgust .  <eos>   mrs . weston ' s communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax .  <eos>   mrs . elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly .  <eos>   i thought i could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you .  <eos>   the tone implied some old acquaintance -- and how could she possibly guess ?  <eos>   he had left them completely frightened ; and harriet eagerly clinging to him , and hardly able to speak , had just strength enough to reach hartfield , before her spirits were quite overcome .  <eos>   emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed .  <eos>   but here you are in bath , and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot .  <eos>   lively as he was , it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but what decided her belief on the subject , was his staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury .  <eos>   she knew the importance of it , and said every thing in her power to do it away .  <eos>   " my dear mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself !  <eos>   it was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults , what would mr . churchill do without her ?  <eos>   " now i have done ," cried captain wentworth .  <eos>   " my father would say ` yes ,' mr . knightley ` no ;' and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium .  <eos>   but the case is altered now .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   emma could say no more .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest .-- to emma ' s entreaties and assurances succeeded mr . knightley ' s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion .-- they had all the assistance which isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and mrs . weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr . woodhouse ' s mind .-- it was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place .  <eos>   her power with him was gone for ever .  <eos>   weston .]  <eos>   charade .  <eos>   they had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since henrietta ' s coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and captain benwick was not inconsolable .  <eos>   one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance .  <eos>   i should have visited admiral croft , however , at any rate .  <eos>   miss fairfax , i dare say , would not have me if i were to ask her -- and i am very sure i shall never ask her ."  <eos>   anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking .  <eos>   but then , is not it the same with many other professions , perhaps most other ?  <eos>   but while i visit at hartfield , and you are so kind to me , miss woodhouse , i am not afraid of what any body can do ."  <eos>   i shall write to mrs . partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible ."  <eos>   she felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her .  <eos>   it was an alarming change ; and emma was thinking of it one morning , as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her , when mr . knightley came in , and distressing thoughts were put by .  <eos>   henrietta asked him what he thought of you , when they went away , and he said , ` you were so altered he should not have known you again .'"  <eos>   i believe he is one of the very best - tempered men that ever existed .  <eos>   they met with the utmost friendliness .  <eos>   i would be understood to mean , that it can be only weak , irresolute characters , ( whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance ,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience , an oppression for ever ."  <eos>   may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at randalls , but at the crown inn ?"  <eos>   poor harriet !"  <eos>   my regard for hartfield is most warm "--  <eos>   i hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy .  <eos>   it is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to ."  <eos>   mrs . smallridge , a most delightful woman !-- a style of living almost equal to maple grove -- and as to the children , except the little sucklings and little bragges , there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere .  <eos>   " ha !  <eos>   is this fair , mrs .  <eos>   captain wentworth had no fortune .  <eos>   in my bath life , i have seen such instances of it !  <eos>   emma had done .  <eos>   i must have given you up ."  <eos>   people of the name of tupman , very lately settled there , and encumbered with many low connexions , but giving themselves immense airs , and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families .  <eos>   " might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it !  <eos>   perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me ."  <eos>   he had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchill ' s engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her .-- the rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings .  <eos>   another slice of cold meat , another draught of madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us ."  <eos>   she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday .  <eos>   you find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think i shall succeed ."  <eos>   this was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done .  <eos>   i am sure she will be pleased with the children .  <eos>   " none ; not one .  <eos>   the decree is issued by somebody .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   this is the simple truth ."  <eos>   " i am very glad you were well enough , and i hope you had a pleasant party ."  <eos>   the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day .  <eos>   " and , upon my word , they have an air of great probability .  <eos>   chapter xiii  <eos>   john knightley came ; but mr . weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day .  <eos>   i was the last man who commanded her .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life ."  <eos>   knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said ,  <eos>   he had a comfortable home for her , and emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world .  <eos>   now i am secure of you for ever ."  <eos>   what a strange thing love is !  <eos>   i think it admirable ; and , as far as i can answer for myself , shall be most happy -- it seems the only improvement that could be .  <eos>   the wedding was no distant event , as the parties had only themselves to please , and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for ; and when he set out for bath again , there was a general expectation , which a certain glance of mrs . cole ' s did not seem to contradict , that when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride .  <eos>   " they would look around them , no doubt , and bless their good fortune ," said mrs clay , for mrs clay was present : her father had driven her over , nothing being of so much use to mrs clay ' s health as a drive to kellynch : " but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant .  <eos>   " they aimed at wounding more than harriet ," said he .  <eos>   they had been once more in the same room .  <eos>   they had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before , and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence .  <eos>   i was snowed up at a friend ' s house once for a week .  <eos>   she was feeling too much ; but at last emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting , and the sort of pain it was creating .  <eos>   what can it possibly be ?  <eos>   besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach .  <eos>   " my dear sir , do not make a stranger of me ."  <eos>   " dating from three o ' clock yesterday .  <eos>   you had better look about you , and ascertain what you do , and what you mean to do ."  <eos>   " ought to refuse him !  <eos>   for the very moment mr . cole told mrs . cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me .  <eos>   _her_ change was equal .-- this one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or distrust .-- on his side , there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of frank churchill .-- he had been in love with emma , and jealous of frank churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other .  <eos>   i give you notice -- you will find me a formidable antagonist on that point .  <eos>   as they were turning into the grounds , mr . perry passed by on horseback .  <eos>   the intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by emma and mr .  <eos>   my only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him .  <eos>   such personal praise might have struck her , especially as it did not appear to anne that the freckles were at all lessened .  <eos>   with great indignation did he continue to observe him ; with great alarm and distrust , to observe also his two blinded companions .  <eos>   harriet listened , and emma drew in peace .  <eos>   they had not a fault to find in him .  <eos>   they think charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell , and that therefore , she persuaded anne to refuse him ."  <eos>   they will have their barouche - landau , of course , which holds four perfectly ; and therefore , without saying any thing of _our_ carriage , we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well .  <eos>   i do not know what he would be at .  <eos>   the affection of such a man as mr . elton would have been too great a distinction .-- she never could have deserved him -- and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible .  <eos>   he had no reason to wish his hair longer , to conceal any confusion of face ; no reason to wish the money unspent , to improve his spirits .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   neither lady russell nor mr elliot could admire the letter ; but it did all that was wanted , in bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess .  <eos>   you will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room -- i want her to lie down upon the bed .  <eos>   when a gallant young man , like mr . frank churchill ," said mr . knightley dryly , " writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best ."  <eos>   " you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time .  <eos>   the like reserve prevailed on other topics .  <eos>   " i think , harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr . martin .  <eos>   i always fetch the letters when i am here .  <eos>   the crofts must be in bath !  <eos>   " no , i fancy not ," replied mrs . elton , with a most satisfied smile ."  <eos>   i know it has .  <eos>   a situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ' s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly ."  <eos>   however , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration .  <eos>   from our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so .-- whether miss woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , i cannot say ;-- when i called to take leave of her , i remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth , and i then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but i have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree .-- she may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part .  <eos>   it need not detain us long .  <eos>   she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other .  <eos>   while he spoke , emma ' s mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word -- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that harriet ' s hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself .-- and not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that harriet ' s secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not .-- it was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two -- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , emma had it not .  <eos>   the stupidest fellow !  <eos>   this was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the great house at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages , mr musgrove ' s coach containing the four ladies , and charles ' s curricle , in which he drove captain wentworth , were descending the long hill into lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone .  <eos>   things did not seem -- that is , there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some .-- so it appeared to me at least , but i might be mistaken .  <eos>   donwell was famous for its strawberry - beds , which seemed a plea for the invitation : but no plea was necessary ; cabbage - beds would have been enough to tempt the lady , who only wanted to be going somewhere .  <eos>   she could then see more and judge better .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse taken from hartfield !-- no , he felt that it ought not to be attempted .  <eos>   and as to captain wentworth ' s liking louisa as well as henrietta , it is nonsense to say so ; for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best .  <eos>   mr . knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of isabella ' s husband .  <eos>   he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by mrs . weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter .  <eos>   mr . elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her ' s , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit ;-- but emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being " very cold , certainly very cold ," and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening .  <eos>   captain wentworth , who had caught her up , knelt with her in his arms , looking on her with a face as pallid as her own , in an agony of silence .  <eos>   emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the crown .  <eos>   " but you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning ."  <eos>   it had no advantage of situation ; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor ; and , such as it was , there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes .-- emma ' s remark was --  <eos>   i hope i know better now , than to care for mr . martin , or to be suspected of it ."  <eos>   well , i was persuaded there were two .  <eos>   her father and sister were glad to see her , for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture , and met her with kindness .  <eos>   miss bates , let emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart -- a _very_ little bit .  <eos>   " the sooner every party breaks up , the better ."  <eos>   such opposition , as these feelings produced , was more than anne could combat .  <eos>   always my kindest friend on every occasion .  <eos>   there were wishes at randalls respecting emma ' s destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which mr . knightley soon afterwards made to " what does weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ?"  <eos>   i had a letter from him this morning , and he will be with us within a fortnight ."  <eos>   i never could have an idea of any body else -- and so i thought you knew .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse talked over his alarms , and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude .  <eos>   his mother and sisters were very fond of him .  <eos>   it will be a great deal better than leaving him only with jemima .  <eos>   she was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again .  <eos>   he was invited to kellynch hall ; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year ; but he never came .  <eos>   ` well ,' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now .'  <eos>   " ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill .  <eos>   warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still .  <eos>   " sir henry russell ' s widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot .  <eos>   " oh god !  <eos>   she was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain .  <eos>   my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration .  <eos>   her many beginnings were displayed .  <eos>   mrs . weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and frank churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top .  <eos>   " these matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them .  <eos>   " poor miss taylor !-- i wish she were here again .  <eos>   she had called on her former governess , and had heard from her of there being an old school - fellow in bath , who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering .  <eos>   he is desperately in love and means to marry her ."  <eos>   " to be sure , so it is .  <eos>   she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations .  <eos>   and not only did it appear that he was expected , and speedily , but the musgroves , in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor dick , and very high respect for his character , stamped as it was by poor dick ' s having been six months under his care , and mentioning him in strong , though not perfectly well - spelt praise , as " a fine dashing felow , only two perticular about the schoolmaster ," were bent on introducing themselves , and seeking his acquaintance , as soon as they could hear of his arrival .  <eos>   " it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion ," said mr . knightley .  <eos>   frank comes to - morrow -- i had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty -- he is at oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; i knew it would be so .  <eos>   he found he could not be useful , and his feelings were too much irritated for talking .  <eos>   but still , there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath ; and as for the men !  <eos>   he will be so pleased to see my little ones ."  <eos>   he does not care about jane fairfax .  <eos>   the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry .  <eos>   " there is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment ," said she , " that i cannot have a doubt as to mr . elton ' s intentions .  <eos>   it is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble .  <eos>   and ( raising his voice still more ) i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too .  <eos>   cried harriet , colouring , and astonished .  <eos>   yes , i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr . and mrs . dixon .  <eos>   she could not think that harriet ' s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ;-- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- " mr . elton is so good to the poor !"  <eos>   if she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and i am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- but , miss smith , indeed !-- oh !  <eos>   he could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful .  <eos>   i am sure you did not much expect to like us .  <eos>   i was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well .  <eos>   how fast i made money in her .  <eos>   this had just taken place and with great cordiality , when john knightley made his appearance , and " how d ' ye do , george ?"  <eos>   " and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her !  <eos>   emma ' s politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest --  <eos>   " harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would ."  <eos>   " but you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning ."  <eos>   she was proved to have been universally mistaken ; and she had not quite done nothing -- for she had done mischief .  <eos>   " mrs . elton , i suppose , has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes --"  <eos>   but these measures , however good in themselves , were insufficient for the real extent of the evil , the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards .  <eos>   her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy .  <eos>   they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment ."  <eos>   such opposition , as these feelings produced , was more than anne could combat .  <eos>   " my dear isabella ,"-- exclaimed he hastily --" pray do not concern yourself about my looks .  <eos>   freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him .  <eos>   he owed it to her , to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference , rather than her welfare ; to encounter any thing , rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause .  <eos>   with the exception of this little blot , emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him .  <eos>   now there would be pleasure in her returning -- every thing would be a pleasure .  <eos>   they had taken out a young dog , who had spoilt their sport , and sent them back early .  <eos>   now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs . goddard ' s to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch ."  <eos>   harriet ' s features are very delicate , which makes a likeness difficult ; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch ."  <eos>   nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind ;-- and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her !-- it certainly was very extraordinary !-- and knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more .  <eos>   the public pays and must be served well ."  <eos>   " if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like jane fairfax ' s .-- of such , one may almost say , that ` the world is not their ' s , nor the world ' s law .'"  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   " here comes this dear old beau of mine , i protest !-- only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men !-- what a dear creature he is ;-- i assure you i like him excessively .  <eos>   i honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart .  <eos>   " ay , that we shall ."  <eos>   and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first ; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind , and sour the temper .  <eos>   i am not like jane ; i wish i were .  <eos>   " it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer -- but it seems a case of necessity .  <eos>   as for me , my judgment is worth nothing .  <eos>   mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot ' s knock ."  <eos>   the style of the visit , and the shortness of it , were then felt to be decisive .  <eos>   " your feelings are singular .  <eos>   i have known a good deal of the profession ; and besides their liberality , they are so neat and careful in all their ways !  <eos>   chapter ii  <eos>   hardly fit for service then .  <eos>   " and who do you think came in while we were there ?"  <eos>   he gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness .  <eos>   " but i ," he soon added , " who have had no such charm thrown over my senses , must still see , hear , and remember .  <eos>   after a moment ' s pause , captain wentworth said --  <eos>   i am sorry mr . and mrs . cole should have done it .  <eos>   they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment ."  <eos>   on this article i can fully acquit him .  <eos>   i do not know .  <eos>   " emma , i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but i must still use it .  <eos>   between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters .  <eos>   dr . hughes i declare -- and mrs . hughes .  <eos>   emma said it would be awkward ; mrs . weston was in distress about the supper ; and mr . woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health .  <eos>   she was a benevolent , charitable , good woman , and capable of strong attachments , most correct in her conduct , strict in her notions of decorum , and with manners that were held a standard of good - breeding .  <eos>   " but , my dear sir ," cried mr . weston , " if emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party ."  <eos>   hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth among the musgroves and their dependencies .  <eos>   he had reached randalls the evening before .  <eos>   how did miss campbell appear to like it ?"  <eos>   jane will be treated with such regard and kindness !-- it will be nothing but pleasure , a life of pleasure .-- and her salary !-- i really cannot venture to name her salary to you , miss woodhouse .  <eos>   " there is nothing so bad as a separation .  <eos>   she continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind .  <eos>   have patience with me , i shall soon have done .-- she closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again .-- _she_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_ : _she_ _dissolved_ _it_ .-- this letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt ' s death .  <eos>   he was here only a quarter of an hour , and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay -- but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said .  <eos>   emma ' s project of forgetting mr . elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her .  <eos>   i can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation .  <eos>   she had no scruple with regard to him .  <eos>   captain wentworth , however , came from his window , apparently not ill - disposed for conversation ; but charles hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table , and taking up the newspaper ; and captain wentworth returned to his window .  <eos>   i am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and i kept sitting near the door !-- oh !  <eos>   i absolutely must go in by myself , though i hate being stuck up in the barouche - landau without a companion ; but augusta , i believe , with her own good - will , would never stir beyond the park paling .'  <eos>   that was the act of a very , very young man , one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure .  <eos>   however , at any rate , as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have , i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me ."  <eos>   " i must have asked miss fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your ' s ."  <eos>   he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte , and turning to emma , said ,  <eos>   mrs . john knightley was a pretty , elegant little woman , of gentle , quiet manners , and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate ; wrapt up in her family ; a devoted wife , a doating mother , and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that , but for these higher ties , a warmer love might have seemed impossible .  <eos>   _now_ you have nothing to try for .  <eos>   they , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed .  <eos>   the quiet , heart - felt satisfaction of the old lady , and the rapturous delight of her daughter -- who proved even too joyous to talk as usual , had been a gratifying , yet almost an affecting , scene .  <eos>   i could change my shoes , you know , the moment i got home ; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold ."  <eos>   " if you were never particularly struck by her manners before ," said she , " i think you will to - day .  <eos>   at ten years old , she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen .  <eos>   when this was told , his name distressed her no longer .  <eos>   she went on , however .  <eos>   they are to be new set .  <eos>   he was not allowed to escape , however .  <eos>   " so do i ," said mrs . weston gently , " very much ."  <eos>   i am very angry with you ."  <eos>   and this , without much waiting for an answer ; or in the young ladies ' addition of , " i hope we shall be in bath in the winter ; but remember , papa , if we do go , we must be in a good situation : none of your queen squares for us !"  <eos>   to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply , than ,  <eos>   " i am not fond of dinner - visiting ," said he --" i never was .  <eos>   mr . elton , who might marry any body !  <eos>   a house was never taken good care of , mr shepherd observed , without a lady : he did not know , whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady , as where there were many children .  <eos>   name your day , and i will come .  <eos>   if jane does not get well soon , we will call in mr . perry .  <eos>   i have been walking all this way in complete suspense .  <eos>   and mrs .  <eos>   did you ever hear of that ?-- a water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard .  <eos>   i dare say , miss fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to broadwood himself .  <eos>   she was always on friendly terms with her brother - in - law ; and in the children , who loved her nearly as well , and respected her a great deal more than their mother , she had an object of interest , amusement , and wholesome exertion .  <eos>   " harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here .  <eos>   and i will own to you , ( i am sure it will be safe ), that so far as our living with mr . churchill at enscombe , it is settled .  <eos>   she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill .  <eos>   i had known you by character , however , long before ."  <eos>   now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs . goddard ' s to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch ."  <eos>   and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man .  <eos>   emma was in no danger of forgetting .  <eos>   much , much beyond impropriety !-- it has sunk him , i cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion .  <eos>   " no , i have not ; i know nothing ; pray tell me ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " no , no ," said emma , " it will not reckon low .  <eos>   harriet slept at hartfield that night .  <eos>   while poor mrs . churchill lived , i suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility ;-- but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required .  <eos>   " family connexions were always worth preserving , good company always worth seeking ; lady dalrymple had taken a house , for three months , in laura place , and would be living in style .  <eos>   do as you please ."  <eos>   harriet listened , and emma drew in peace .  <eos>   " a straightforward , open - hearted man like weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like miss taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns .  <eos>   you make the best of it -- but after you have been a week at hartfield , you are all of you different creatures ; you do not look like the same .  <eos>   i wish she had accepted him .  <eos>   mary had been hysterical again this morning .  <eos>   no -- i am grieved to find -- i was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs . goddard ' s door , which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress , i was told that miss smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse .  <eos>   i wish i had looked at him more .  <eos>   i could almost assert that you had _named_ mr . frank churchill .  <eos>   he made no answer ; merely looked , and bowed in submission ; and soon afterwards said , in a lively tone ,  <eos>   " we had better not talk about it , my dear ," replied mrs croft , pleasantly ; " for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding , she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together .  <eos>   it was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference .  <eos>   so silly -- so satisfied -- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious -- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , i would marry to - morrow .  <eos>   mrs . weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured .  <eos>   her husband had been extravagant ; and at his death , about two years before , had left his affairs dreadfully involved .  <eos>   " it is over !  <eos>   few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did , nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society .  <eos>   it suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred on the very account of charles hayter , whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to .  <eos>   " there might be scruples of delicacy , my dear emma .  <eos>   he was always agreeable and obliging , and speaking pleasantly of every body .  <eos>   that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents .  <eos>   i wish he could have such company oftener .  <eos>   the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and mr . woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor isabella ;-- which poor isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness .  <eos>   what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream !  <eos>   i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly .  <eos>   if he were quite sincere , if he really tried to come , it was to be inferred that mrs . churchill ' s removal to london had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder .  <eos>   gilbert ."  <eos>   mr . knightley was thoughtful again .  <eos>   if i had but her memory !  <eos>   he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of emma .  <eos>   mr hayter had some property of his own , but it was insignificant compared with mr musgrove ' s ; and while the musgroves were in the first class of society in the country , the young hayters would , from their parents ' inferior , retired , and unpolished way of living , and their own defective education , have been hardly in any class at all , but for their connexion with uppercross , this eldest son of course excepted , who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman , and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest .  <eos>   she had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life , and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen ; a wish that they had more pride ; for " our cousins lady dalrymple and miss carteret ;" " our cousins , the dalrymples ," sounded in her ears all day long .  <eos>   " is not she ?  <eos>   he looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added , " _she_ ought not to be angry with you , i suspect , whatever he may be .-- to that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , emma , that you did want him to marry harriet ."  <eos>   " it is over !  <eos>   she could not enter the house again , could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to lace up her boot , without _recollecting_ .  <eos>   no -- i never conceived you could become indifferent .  <eos>   " she was very much honoured , and should be happy in their acquaintance ."  <eos>   well , ( smiling ,) i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important .  <eos>   perry .-- i want his directions no more than his drugs ."  <eos>   when the evening was over , anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination .  <eos>   " the evil of the distance from enscombe ," said mr . weston , " is , that mrs . churchill , _as_ _we_ _understand_ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together .  <eos>   how was she to bear the change ?-- it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs . weston , only half a mile from them , and a miss taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .  <eos>   what a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure !  <eos>   and i need not bring the whole family , you know ."  <eos>   his ostensible reason , however , was to ask whether mr . woodhouse ' s party could be made up in the evening without him , or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield .  <eos>   perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished .  <eos>   what , in heaven ' s name , is to be done next ?"  <eos>   the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other ."  <eos>   " you should have gone to cromer , my dear , if you went anywhere .-- perry was a week at cromer once , and he holds it to be the best of all the sea - bathing places .  <eos>   and then , her reserve -- i never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved ."  <eos>   i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began .  <eos>   anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion , though too wise to acknowledge as much at home , where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife ; for while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite , she could not but think , as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience , that captain wentworth was not in love with either .  <eos>   her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost .  <eos>   mr musgrove was , in a lesser degree , affected likewise ; and when they reached the cottage , they were evidently in want , first , of being listened to anew on this subject , and afterwards , of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them .  <eos>   a mrs . knightley for them all to give way to !-- no -- mr .  <eos>   he sat by her at dinner .  <eos>   i am sure he has not the least idea of it .  <eos>   then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in cheshire ; how mentioned in dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of charles ii , with all the marys and elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto :--" principal seat , kellynch hall , in the county of somerset ," and sir walter ' s handwriting again in this finale :--  <eos>   cried harriet indignantly .--" oh !  <eos>   leave shame to her .  <eos>   i planned the match from that hour ; and when such success has blessed me in this instance , dear papa , you cannot think that i shall leave off match - making ."  <eos>   " indeed !-- from yorkshire , i think .  <eos>   the sympathy and good - will excited towards captain benwick was very great .  <eos>   so she thought at first ;-- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off .  <eos>   she replied with a smile of astonishment , " are you imagining me to be mr . elton ' s object ?"  <eos>   " very true , very true , indeed .  <eos>   it was a long , well - written letter , giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings , expressing all the affection , gratitude , and respect which was natural and honourable , and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive , with spirit and precision .  <eos>   and here i can admit , that my manners to miss w ., in being unpleasant to miss f ., were highly blameable .  <eos>   from thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of mrs musgrove ' s who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying --  <eos>   emma had hardly expected them : for mr . weston , who had called in for half a minute , in order to hear that his son was very handsome , knew nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking up to the house together , arm in arm .  <eos>   if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days ; i was always glad he did not come at christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather .  <eos>   they must not do less than others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions , and imagined capable of pitiful resentment .  <eos>   she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding .  <eos>   he could say no more ; and with the hope of hartfield to reward him , returned with mrs . weston to mrs . bates ' s door .  <eos>   her visit to abbey - mill , this summer , seems to have done his business .  <eos>   how could it be ?  <eos>   her parting look was grateful -- and her parting words , " oh !  <eos>   " i do remember it ," cried emma ; " i perfectly remember it .-- talking about spruce - beer .-- oh !  <eos>   the scenes in its neighbourhood , charmouth , with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country , and still more , its sweet , retired bay , backed by dark cliffs , where fragments of low rock among the sands , make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide , for sitting in unwearied contemplation ; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme ; and , above all , pinny , with its green chasms between romantic rocks , where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth , declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state , where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited , as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far - famed isle of wight : these places must be visited , and visited again , to make the worth of lyme understood .  <eos>   a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " must i go first ?  <eos>   with men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works ."  <eos>   with such an opinion , in confirmation of his own , mr . woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair ; but still the cake was eaten ; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone .  <eos>   in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card - tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and in the proper order .  <eos>   she was a widow and poor .  <eos>   perhaps he had quitted the field , had given louisa up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her .  <eos>   " oh , dear ," cried harriet , " now i recollect what you mean ; but i was thinking of something very different at the time .  <eos>   the conclusion of the whole was , that if the woman who had been sensible of captain wentworth ' s merits could be allowed to prefer another man , there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder ; and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it , certainly nothing to be regretted .  <eos>   it might be a very indifferent piece of wit , but emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it -- and so did frank and harriet .-- it did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally ; some looked very stupid about it , and mr . knightley gravely said ,  <eos>   it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast .  <eos>   sir walter , on being applied to , without actually withholding his consent , or saying it should never be , gave it all the negative of great astonishment , great coldness , great silence , and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter .  <eos>   could i mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to mrs . goddard ?  <eos>   her power with him was gone for ever .  <eos>   anne haggard , mary coarse , every face in the neighbourhood worsting , and the rapid increase of the crow ' s foot about lady russell ' s temples had long been a distress to him .  <eos>   " very odd !  <eos>   a ready - furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged , and much benefit expected from the change .  <eos>   but first of all , there must be an answer written to mrs .  <eos>   " oh yes , sir ," cried she with ready sympathy , " how you must miss her !  <eos>   to spare henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle .  <eos>   somebody else believed _mrs_ .  <eos>   then she had , indeed , been a pitiable object ; for she had caught cold on the journey , and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain ; and all this among strangers , with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse , and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense .  <eos>   mrs . weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event .-- she had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost .-- she had such a regard for mr . knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago .-- how very few of those men in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own home for hartfield !  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   he is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with harriet ' s .  <eos>   always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister , made the book an evil ; and more than once , when her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away .  <eos>   this , on his side , might merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their friendship were declining .  <eos>   elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally .  <eos>   if it failed to produce equal exertion , it could not be an equal conviction ."  <eos>   yes , i see what she means , ( turning to mr . knightley ,) and i will try to hold my tongue .  <eos>   smallridge , too !  <eos>   the charm of kellynch and of " lady elliot " all faded away .  <eos>   you are trying not to smile ."  <eos>   he seemed not merely happy with her , but proud .  <eos>   but what can be the matter ?-- is she really not ill ?"  <eos>   there might really have been a liking formerly , though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way ; and now that he could afford to please himself , he might mean to pay his addresses to her .  <eos>   said jane , shaking her head ; " dear mrs . elton , who can have thought of it as i have done ?"  <eos>   mrs . elton ' s resources were inadequate to such an attack .  <eos>   she had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period .  <eos>   most comfortable carriage .-- oh !  <eos>   while they talked , they were advancing towards the carriage ; it was ready ; and , before she could speak again , he had handed her in .  <eos>   pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once ."  <eos>   yes , and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance .  <eos>   though it was rather desirable that mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay ; yet the time required by the uppercross horses to take them back , would be a dreadful extension of suspense ; and captain wentworth proposed , and charles musgrove agreed , that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn , and leave mr musgrove ' s carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early , when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of louisa ' s night .  <eos>   " dear emma bears every thing so well ," said her father .  <eos>   so would poor little harriet .  <eos>   the loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man -- and all that the young man might be feeling !-- it was too wretched !-- such a delightful evening as it would have been !-- every body so happy !  <eos>   if it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that i may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of highbury .  <eos>   she read it to him , just as he liked to have any thing read , slowly and distinctly , and two or three times over , with explanations of every part as she proceeded -- and he was very much pleased , and , as she had foreseen , especially struck with the complimentary conclusion .  <eos>   said frank churchill .  <eos>   these were charming feelings -- but not lasting .  <eos>   and now , miss woodhouse , i do not think i shall mind seeing them again .  <eos>   said miss bates , joyfully ; " my mother is so pleased !-- she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress .  <eos>   having alluded to " an accident ," he must hear the whole .  <eos>   if i am a fool , i shall be a fool indeed , for i have thought on the subject more than most men ."  <eos>   mrs musgrove was of a comfortable , substantial size , infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour , than tenderness and sentiment ; and while the agitations of anne ' s slender form , and pensive face , may be considered as very completely screened , captain wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self - command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son , whom alive nobody had cared for .  <eos>   i hope she is well ?"  <eos>   does mrs . churchill do the same ?"  <eos>   i was the last man who commanded her .  <eos>   good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice .  <eos>   even emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment , and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others , or sitting almost alone , and quite unattended to , in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her .  <eos>   so sudden !-- you may guess , dear miss woodhouse , what a flurry it has thrown me in !  <eos>   though neither henrietta , nor louisa , nor charles hayter , nor captain wentworth were there , the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in .  <eos>   do not distress her ."  <eos>   exclaimed emma .  <eos>   would i be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do , and that i knew to be right , by the airs and interference of such a person , or of any person i may say ?  <eos>   they knew not each other ' s opinion , either its constancy or its change , on the one leading point of anne ' s conduct , for the subject was never alluded to ; but anne , at seven - and - twenty , thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen .  <eos>   " such an extraordinary dream of mine !"  <eos>   she found , however , that it was one to which she must inure herself .  <eos>   " i mentioned no _names_ , you will observe .-- oh !  <eos>   upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated .  <eos>   harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of .  <eos>   he had been used to think her unjust to jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement .  <eos>   emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to mrs . weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy -- yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming .-- mrs . weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : " for i cannot depend upon his coming .  <eos>   sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr . woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of emma .  <eos>   in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day , or poor mrs . weston would be disappointed .  <eos>   she was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness , among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past , which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   the very day of mr . elton ' s going to london produced a fresh occasion for emma ' s services towards her friend .  <eos>   his wish of staying longer evidently did not please ; but it was not opposed .  <eos>   it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature .  <eos>   should not this be enough for a sailor , who has had no society among women to make him nice ?"  <eos>   she is a sweet creature !  <eos>   i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight .  <eos>   harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love .  <eos>   but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax , i never could , under any blunder , have spoken ill of her ; and as to speaking ill of him , there i must have been safe ."  <eos>   i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him ; he sent in letters , but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth .  <eos>   she had much to recover from , before she could move .  <eos>   but you are too good for that , i am sure ."  <eos>   -- " he was generally thought so ."  <eos>   the invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like mrs . elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves .-- emma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and mr . weston , unasked , promised to get frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with .-- mr . knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and mr . weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come .  <eos>   i am not prejudiced ."  <eos>   " yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which i had entertained before .-- i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr . dixon or miss fairfax , but i cannot help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side .  <eos>   jane was quite longing to go to ireland , from his account of things ."  <eos>   ay , so it always is , i believe .  <eos>   with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross , it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination , her memory , and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible .  <eos>   however , i do not mean to set up my opinion against your ' s -- and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife .  <eos>   she did not attribute guile to any .  <eos>   she is not satisfied .  <eos>   she went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in donwell .  <eos>   i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs . goddard .  <eos>   yes , i am sure you are much too reasonable .  <eos>   that very dear part of emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply .  <eos>   they had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time -- till just at last , when mrs . martin ' s saying , all of a sudden , that she thought miss smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner .  <eos>   " who is that gentleman on horseback ?"  <eos>   where is your merit ?  <eos>   " are you expecting miss fairfax here soon ?"  <eos>   mrs . weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem .  <eos>   " my dear papa , he is three - and - twenty .  <eos>   if it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that i may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of highbury .  <eos>   it could be protracted no longer .  <eos>   elton ?"  <eos>   " what is this ?-- what is this ?"  <eos>   that tooth of her ' s and those freckles .  <eos>   it is the greatest absurdity -- actually snowing at this moment !-- the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people ' s not staying comfortably at home when they can !  <eos>   " he is a man ," said lady russell , " whom i have no wish to see .  <eos>   mr elliot had attempted no apology , and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family , as sir walter considered him unworthy of it : all acquaintance between them had ceased .  <eos>   he paused .-- she coloured and laughed .--" i know you saw my letter , and think you may remember my wish in your favour .  <eos>   " very well .  <eos>   you , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _some_ ,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her .-- this is not pleasant to you , emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but i must , i will ,-- i will tell you truths while i can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now ."  <eos>   so far went his understanding ; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing , in the admiral ' s situation in life , which was just high enough , and not too high .  <eos>   she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home .  <eos>   yes -- very -- a very pleasing young woman ."  <eos>   harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father ' s footsteps .  <eos>   the circumstances of his marriage , too , were found to admit of much extenuation .  <eos>   the first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion .  <eos>   i certainly get better and better .-- now for it ."  <eos>   i am very happy .  <eos>   " good god !"  <eos>   " he had better not be in a hurry .  <eos>   a little while ago , every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at mr . cole ' s , or balls at the crown .  <eos>   " well ," said emma , willing to let it pass --" you want to hear about the wedding ; and i shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly .  <eos>   " i assure you she did .  <eos>   " though he had not nerves for coming away with us , and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here , he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself , you may depend on it .  <eos>   my courage rises while i write .  <eos>   pray do not make any more matches ."  <eos>   " no , no ," said emma , " it will not reckon low .  <eos>   emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off .  <eos>   " but you will come again ," said emma .  <eos>   " if i can come again , we are still to have our ball .  <eos>   they met with the utmost friendliness .  <eos>   " and i do envy him , emma .  <eos>   that she is old and sickly .  <eos>   if you want any farther explanation ," continued he , smiling , " they are paid for it .  <eos>   in fact , it does not concern you -- it concerns only myself ,-- that is , we hope .-- humph !-- in short , my dear emma , there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it .  <eos>   she received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which anne perfectly knew the meaning of .  <eos>   elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy , which she wished to see interrupted .  <eos>   she was sure of mrs . weston ' s wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like mr . knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct .  <eos>   she was not so easily to be talked out of it .  <eos>   knightley was at hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for saturday ."  <eos>   i have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and i must tell them while the idea is fresh .  <eos>   the truth of this representation there was no denying .  <eos>   but whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a little longer doubtful .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , as he would have been sorry to see him before .  <eos>   a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill .  <eos>   doubtless it was so , and she could take no revenge , for he was not altered , or not for the worse .  <eos>   get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it ."  <eos>   " miss woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- i have something that i should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over ."  <eos>   could a linguist , could a grammarian , could even a mathematician have seen what she did , have witnessed their appearance together , and heard their history of it , without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other ?-- how much more must an imaginist , like herself , be on fire with speculation and foresight !-- especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made .  <eos>   " dear me !  <eos>   he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes ."  <eos>   louisa was much the same .  <eos>   for a few days , every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs . weston had received .  <eos>   elton !"  <eos>   " i had no notion that he liked me so very much ," said harriet , contemplating the letter .  <eos>   screamed mary , catching hold of her husband , and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable ; and in another moment , henrietta , sinking under the conviction , lost her senses too , and would have fallen on the steps , but for captain benwick and anne , who caught and supported her between them .  <eos>   anne was amused by henrietta ' s manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of henrietta ' s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them .  <eos>   but at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on harriet ' s -- more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint .  <eos>   there was a little hesitation in emma ' s answer .  <eos>   they walked together .  <eos>   precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer ' s hands ; but sir walter had improved it by adding , for the information of himself and his family , these words , after the date of mary ' s birth -- " married , december , , charles , son and heir of charles musgrove , esq .  <eos>   can it be neptune ?  <eos>   chapter i  <eos>   he said he should not stay out long ; but he has never come back , and now it is almost one .  <eos>   i brought her into plymouth ; and here another instance of luck .  <eos>   interrupted emma , " there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over .  <eos>   the result of his reverie was , " no , emma , i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize .-- i never had a thought of her in that way , i assure you ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   not that james ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can .  <eos>   and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club !  <eos>   weston , tell me at once .-- something has happened in brunswick square .  <eos>   he had not left her long , by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else , when a letter was brought her from randalls -- a very thick letter ;-- she guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity of reading it .-- she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill ; she wanted no explanations , she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself -- and as for understanding any thing he wrote , she was sure she was incapable of it .-- it must be waded through , however .  <eos>   you see !"  <eos>   she joined charles and mary , and was tired enough to be very glad of charles ' s other arm ; but charles , though in very good humour with her , was out of temper with his wife .  <eos>   she must not appear to think it a misfortune .-- with all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and mr . knightley meant to marry ; by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person ' s company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and mrs . weston , best in the world .  <eos>   husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain .  <eos>   as i tell mr . e ., you are a thorough humourist .-- yes , believe me , knightley , i am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme .  <eos>   of all houses in the kingdom mrs . bragge ' s is the one i would most wish to see you in ."  <eos>   fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago !-- emma could not but picture it all , and feel how justly they might resent , how naturally harriet must suffer .  <eos>   it had been a very happy fortnight , and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of hartfield days .  <eos>   don ' t let us be severe , don ' t let us be in a hurry to condemn him .  <eos>   cried emma , " i know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her ."  <eos>   no indeed i am not ."  <eos>   i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to - day ."  <eos>   " you are very obliging .-- frank will be extremely happy , i am sure .-- he is to be in town next week , if not sooner .  <eos>   " how do you like mrs .  <eos>   here was a dangerous opening .  <eos>   it was a merry , joyous party , and no one seemed in higher spirits than captain wentworth .  <eos>   now they seemed in pleasant conversation .  <eos>   the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before ."  <eos>   i am sure she will be pleased with the children .  <eos>   it is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to ."  <eos>   frank churchill caught the name .  <eos>   they were interrupted .  <eos>   nonsense !  <eos>   nothing to signify .  <eos>   " but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance ?"  <eos>   but she was not wanted to speak .  <eos>   ladies and gentlemen -- i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way .  <eos>   emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr . martin ' s prose .  <eos>   the power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course .  <eos>   cried harriet indignantly .--" oh !  <eos>   " but still , you will be an old maid !  <eos>   " yes , simpleton as i was !-- but i am quite ashamed of it now , and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them .  <eos>   as for isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr . westons aside as much as she can ."  <eos>   every thing declared it ; his own attentions , his father ' s hints , his mother - in - law ' s guarded silence ; it was all in unison ; words , conduct , discretion , and indiscretion , told the same story .  <eos>   and i am not only , not going to be married , at present , but have very little intention of ever marrying at all ."  <eos>   emma was in no danger of forgetting .  <eos>   your views for harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have ;-- and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man , i think it will be all labour in vain ."  <eos>   on quitting the cobb , they all went in - doors with their new friends , and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many .  <eos>   she promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it .  <eos>   they were sneering and negligent .  <eos>   anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different .  <eos>   one can think of nothing else ."  <eos>   mr . woodhouse could never allow for mr . knightley ' s claims on his brother , or any body ' s claims on isabella , except his own .  <eos>   at the same time , i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware .  <eos>   and for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it , and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel .  <eos>   .  <eos>   if attention , in future , could do away the past , she might hope to be forgiven .  <eos>   " i am very glad you were well enough , and i hope you had a pleasant party ."  <eos>   every invitation was successful .  <eos>   we cannot part ."  <eos>   she could not stay .  <eos>   but you see , every thing turns out for the best .  <eos>   but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me .  <eos>   she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business ; felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought ; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active , respectable young man , as a resident curate , and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate ' s being married .  <eos>   chapter viii  <eos>   " i was very often influenced rightly by you -- oftener than i would own at the time .  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   this is meeting quite in fairy - land !-- such a transformation !-- must not compliment , i know ( eyeing emma most complacently )-- that would be rude -- but upon my word , miss woodhouse , you do look -- how do you like jane ' s hair ?-- you are a judge .-- she did it all herself .  <eos>   i do not understand it .  <eos>   charles heard it quite by chance ; they have not had the civility to give me any notice , or of offering to take anything .  <eos>   the varieties in the fitting - up of the rooms , where the common necessaries provided by the owner , in the common indifferent plight , were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood , excellently worked up , and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries captain harville had visited , were more than amusing to anne ; connected as it all was with his profession , the fruit of its labours , the effect of its influence on his habits , the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented , made it to her a something more , or less , than gratification .  <eos>   i only name possibilities .  <eos>   the dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness ; and when harriet appeared , and in very good spirits , and without having any such reason to give for her long absence , she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind , and convinced her , that let mr . knightley think or say what he would , she had done nothing which woman ' s friendship and woman ' s feelings would not justify .  <eos>   emma , you are a great dreamer , i think ?"  <eos>   it would be such a delight to have her picture !"  <eos>   said emma .  <eos>   lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once , when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again .  <eos>   the sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day ' s sketch to wish to go on .  <eos>   what was his name ?  <eos>   something of a very unpleasant nature , i find , has occurred ;-- do let me know directly what it is .  <eos>   in the very same inn with us !  <eos>   but fetch them both .  <eos>   and emma received a smile which seemed to say , " these are my own concerns .  <eos>   " how is mary looking ?"  <eos>   but harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit .  <eos>   i think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him ."  <eos>   while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse , i could deserve nothing from either .  <eos>   happily for her , they were not many .  <eos>   " you speak too plain .  <eos>   " indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced .  <eos>   i never could comprehend how mr . weston could part with him .  <eos>   perhaps he had quitted the field , had given louisa up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her .  <eos>   dear miss woodhouse , he would be thirty years old !"  <eos>   with a faint blush , she presently replied ,  <eos>   " i wonder he did not remember the book "-- was all harriet ' s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be safely left to itself .  <eos>   mr . knightley might quarrel with her , but emma could not quarrel with herself .  <eos>   he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylor ' s merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouse ' s character , than miss woodhouse miss taylor ' s .  <eos>   to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbell ' s power ; for though his income , by pay and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter ' s ; but , by giving her an education , he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter .  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   lady russell had little taste for wit , and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror .  <eos>   we shall only be making each other more angry .  <eos>   i do not by any means engage for its being returned .  <eos>   i do not advise you to give way to it , harriet .  <eos>   there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr . knightley .  <eos>   they have more gentleness .  <eos>   there is so little real friendship in the world !  <eos>   madam ," cried emma , " if other children are at all like what i remember to have been myself , i should think five times the amount of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned ."  <eos>   every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried .  <eos>   he advised her against it , thought the jar too great ; but no , he reasoned and talked in vain , she smiled and said , " i am determined i will :" he put out his hands ; she was too precipitate by half a second , she fell on the pavement on the lower cobb , and was taken up lifeless !  <eos>   mr . elton was to take the drawing to london , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough .  <eos>   apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr . weston , must necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement .  <eos>   i am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and i kept sitting near the door !-- oh !  <eos>   in speaking of the harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of mrs harville ' s exertions as a nurse .  <eos>   it was a gentleman ' s carriage , a curricle , but only coming round from the stable - yard to the front door ; somebody must be going away .  <eos>   mr . knightley , i wish you had the benefit of this ; i think this would convince you .  <eos>   something of a very unpleasant nature , i find , has occurred ;-- do let me know directly what it is .  <eos>   sir walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner ; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention ; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant , on his own terms , and as a great favour , that he would let it at all .  <eos>   these were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present .  <eos>   mrs . weston , i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith , or my dread of its doing them both harm ."  <eos>   the great mrs . churchill was no more .  <eos>   emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party , and grew uncomfortable .  <eos>   she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault .  <eos>   ` my dear ,' said i , ` i shall say you are laid down upon the bed :' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room .  <eos>   she had had many a hint from mr . knightley and some from her own heart , as to her deficiency -- but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable ,-- a waste of time -- tiresome women -- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second - rate and third - rate of highbury , who were calling on them for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them .  <eos>   lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once , when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again .  <eos>   i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way ."  <eos>   but you , ( turning to mr . knightley ,) who know how very , very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , i cannot imagine .  <eos>   said sir walter .  <eos>   they are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body ' s hurrying away is no great compliment ; and miss woodhouse ' s doing it would be more thought of than any other person ' s in the room .  <eos>   to isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her father ' s account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at randalls .  <eos>   harriet , mr . elton , and mr . knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them ;-- the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; mr . woodhouse ' s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing .  <eos>   the young ladies of highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began , and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma and her nephews :-- in her imagination it maintained its ground , and henry and john were still asking every day for the story of harriet and the gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital .  <eos>   her bath habits made evening - parties perfectly natural to her , and maple grove had given her a taste for dinners .  <eos>   a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood ."  <eos>   we shall soon overtake her .  <eos>   its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind -- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation .  <eos>   he knew of no one but mrs . goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends .  <eos>   " from the very circumstance of its being larger , sir .  <eos>   it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already .  <eos>   " dear me !  <eos>   she deprecated the connexion in every light .  <eos>   her fancy was very active .  <eos>   if not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but miss hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set .  <eos>   to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth , repeating his name so often , puzzling over past years , and at last ascertaining that it might , that it probably would , turn out to be the very same captain wentworth whom they recollected meeting , once or twice , after their coming back from clifton -- a very fine young man -- but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago , was a new sort of trial to anne ' s nerves .  <eos>   but , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend --"  <eos>   how does miss smith do ?  <eos>   " ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill .  <eos>   i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure .  <eos>   this topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation .  <eos>   this , however , was a profound secret , not to be breathed beyond their own circle .  <eos>   " leave it to me .  <eos>   " and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while ; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure ."  <eos>   and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him , for frank , i mean , that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for -- and still am disposed to give her credit for , in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right .  <eos>   they knew he was to dine in lansdown crescent .  <eos>   i felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse .  <eos>   what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged , and with manners so _very_ disengaged ?  <eos>   ten minutes were enough to certify that .  <eos>   " harriet !"  <eos>   soon , however , she began to reason with herself , and try to be feeling less .  <eos>   " what an amiable creature i was !-- no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance ."  <eos>   mr . frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .  <eos>   this was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done .  <eos>   mrs . elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill , she could not lose by the change .  <eos>   the rest was all tranquillity ; till , just as they were moving , she heard the admiral say to mary --  <eos>   he has a great regard for the bateses , you know , independent of jane fairfax -- and is always glad to shew them attention .  <eos>   whenever she is with us , mrs . cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can .  <eos>   he was here only a quarter of an hour , and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay -- but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said .  <eos>   it was well to have a comfort in store on harriet ' s behalf , though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom ; for evil in that quarter was at hand .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   he would be so very .  <eos>   a real injury to the children -- a most mortifying change , and material loss to them all ;-- a very great deduction from her father ' s daily comfort -- and , as to herself , she could not at all endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey .  <eos>   " pretty !  <eos>   she was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with mrs . weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend .  <eos>   no doubt it had been from jealousy .-- in jane ' s eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed .  <eos>   the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry .  <eos>   but she was always right .  <eos>   its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind -- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation .  <eos>   the want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied .  <eos>   i will invite your guests ."  <eos>   " so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them !  <eos>   there was never any burst of feeling , any warmth of indignation or delight , at the evil or good of others .  <eos>   " quite out of the question , quite out of the question ," he replied ;-- " but you must often wish it , i am sure ."  <eos>   she played and sang ;-- and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " whoever colonel campbell might employ ," said frank churchill , with a smile at emma , " the person has not chosen ill .  <eos>   poor girl !  <eos>   anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot .  <eos>   it was her superior duty .  <eos>   " to be sure !"  <eos>   two months must bring it to the proof .  <eos>   i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be .  <eos>   " oh yes , sir ," cried she with ready sympathy , " how you must miss her !  <eos>   ` my dear ,' said i , ` you will blind yourself '-- for tears were in her eyes perpetually .  <eos>   she had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious .  <eos>   said she .  <eos>   emma said it would be awkward ; mrs . weston was in distress about the supper ; and mr . woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health .  <eos>   i cannot be so sanguine as mr . weston .  <eos>   we shall only be making each other more angry .  <eos>   but so eager and so resolute !  <eos>   my dear sir , you really are too bountiful .  <eos>   on going down to breakfast the next morning , she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady ' s side of meaning to leave them .  <eos>   " not till the first week of august , when he came home from the cape , just made into the grappler .  <eos>   he never can bear to be thanked .  <eos>   the admiral ' s kind urgency came in support of his wife ' s ; they would not be refused ; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner , and captain wentworth , without saying a word , turned to her , and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage .  <eos>   if he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , i dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had .  <eos>   chapter xviii  <eos>   " and here is mrs . weston and mr . frank churchill too !-- quite delightful ; so many friends !"  <eos>   it would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers .  <eos>   where a man does his best with only moderate powers , he will have the advantage over negligent superiority .  <eos>   if one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the coles , for instance .  <eos>   i like them all ."  <eos>   " you think so , do you ?-- i wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge .  <eos>   " me !-- i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell ' s being so rich and so liberal .-- it is a handsome present ."  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   they could go there again with them in the autumn .  <eos>   one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal ,-- the ball at the crown .  <eos>   it was no more than a wish .  <eos>   when she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but mr . elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and mrs . weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by significant glances .-- the kind - hearted , gentle mrs . weston had left her seat to join him and say , " do not you dance , mr .  <eos>   she would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out .  <eos>   it was foolish , it was wrong , to take so active a part in bringing any two people together .  <eos>   " so prettily done !  <eos>   every minute is valuable .  <eos>   the next remove was to the house ; they must all go in and eat ;-- and they were all seated and busy , and still frank churchill did not come .  <eos>   " indeed , i am very sorry to be right in this instance .  <eos>   when he was here before , we made the best of it ; but there was a good deal of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always is in february , you know , and we could not do half that we intended .  <eos>   and it was soon over .  <eos>   it would be a capital match for either of his sisters ."  <eos>   " and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?-- i pity you .-- i thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .  <eos>   henrietta looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased ;-- charles hayter exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross .  <eos>   she is a standing lesson of how to be happy .  <eos>   i have heard him express himself so warmly on those points !-- such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice !  <eos>   nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her -- james is so obliged to you !"  <eos>   elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match .  <eos>   mr . perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill .  <eos>   husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain .  <eos>   he sat down with them , and improved their conversation very much .  <eos>   captain benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance .  <eos>   under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , i know you have the warmest heart .  <eos>   he sat by her at dinner .  <eos>   i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways .  <eos>   " to be sure you did .  <eos>   it was precisely what emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing .  <eos>   they vindicated him against the base aspersion .  <eos>   musgrove , take care of the others ."  <eos>   indeed i must say that , much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected , he very far exceeds any thing .  <eos>   and the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more i shall like you ."  <eos>   repeated mrs . elton .  <eos>   even _your_ satisfaction i made sure of .  <eos>   he had never had an idea of throwing himself off ; he had feared that he was thrown off , but knew not why , and delicacy had kept him silent .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   anne will send for me if anything is the matter ."  <eos>   she did not regret it .  <eos>   anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house ; and louisa , by whom she found herself walking , burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy ; their friendliness , their brotherliness , their openness , their uprightness ; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england ; that they only knew how to live , and they only deserved to be respected and loved .  <eos>   sir walter would quit kellynch hall ; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision , the great question of whither he should go was settled , and the first outline of this important change made out .  <eos>   " a man ," said he , " must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him .  <eos>   " it would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ?"  <eos>   he was often hoping , intending to come -- but was always prevented .  <eos>   anne smiled and said ,  <eos>   it was a very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening .  <eos>   miss fairfax must already have given her account .-- i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow ."  <eos>   cried mr .  <eos>   might not the evening end in a dance ?  <eos>   she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish .  <eos>   mrs . goddard , what say you to _half_ a glass of wine ?  <eos>   she could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable .  <eos>   we were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance ."  <eos>   " say nothing , my dear emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of mrs . elton .  <eos>   she checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved .  <eos>   emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him .  <eos>   if you wish me to talk to mrs . hodges , or to inspect anything --"  <eos>   " he was too good !-- she could not endure the thought !-- she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world ,"-- brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances ,-- and a very few minutes settled the business .  <eos>   do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfax ' s sensations from you , or from any body else .  <eos>   forty ?"  <eos>   frank churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs . weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax , followed mr . cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .  <eos>   she was vexed .  <eos>   he had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour , without pride or weakness ; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune , without display ; he judged for himself in everything essential , without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum .  <eos>   emma had not had time even to think of mr . elton , and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start , and a little blush , at the sound .  <eos>   " this is too bad ," cried emma , as they turned away .  <eos>   the less worthy females were to come in the evening , with miss bates , miss fairfax , and miss smith ; but already , at dinner , they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general ; and , while politics and mr . elton were talked over , emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour .  <eos>   " what should they do without her ?  <eos>   " it is impossible for me to doubt any longer .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " do let us have the pleasure of taking you home .  <eos>   his civilities to the other ladies must be paid ; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering , and the walk he had had for nothing .  <eos>   it was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it :-- elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in highbury .  <eos>   i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , emma .  <eos>   " and so then , i suppose ," said mrs musgrove , in a low voice , as if thinking aloud , " so then he went away to the laconia , and there he met with our poor boy .  <eos>   in a worldly view , he had nothing to gain by being on terms with sir walter ; nothing to risk by a state of variance .  <eos>   his acquittal was complete , his friendship warmly honoured , a lively interest excited for his friend , and his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to by the party , that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves , and a project for going thither was the consequence .  <eos>   while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to anne ' s lot to be placed rather apart with captain benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him .  <eos>   it was driven by a servant in mourning .  <eos>   " charming miss woodhouse !  <eos>   you must have seen that i did .  <eos>   but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present ."  <eos>   he had left the country in consequence .  <eos>   chapter xvii  <eos>   " you owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even --"  <eos>   a better written letter , harriet ( returning it ,) than i had expected ."  <eos>   my dear admiral , that post !  <eos>   this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma , mr .  <eos>   the expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know .  <eos>   emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about mr . frank churchill ' s not coming , except as a disappointment at randalls .  <eos>   the " how d ' ye do ' s " were quiet and constrained on each side .  <eos>   keep your raptures for harriet ' s face .  <eos>   mr . cole said how much taste you had ; and mr . frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution ."  <eos>   miss nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about mr . elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , " that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom mr . elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , mr . elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness ."  <eos>   said emma playfully .  <eos>   nothing wrong in him escaped her .  <eos>   tell me , i charge you tell me this moment what it is ."  <eos>   that ' s very like .  <eos>   emma was just describing the nature of her friend ' s complaint ;-- " a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c . and she was sorry to find from mrs . goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them ."  <eos>   he endured too well , stood too well with every body .  <eos>   i was not aware of it myself .  <eos>   i told him the distance and the road , and i told him of the church ' s being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , i thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon .  <eos>   four - and - twenty hours later , and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth , in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers ; and being lost in only a sloop , nobody would have thought about me ."  <eos>   no -- till cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head .  <eos>   emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him .  <eos>   you have every body dearest to you always at hand , i , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till i have outlived all my affections , a post - office , i think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day ."  <eos>   an express arrived at randalls to announce the death of mrs . churchill !  <eos>   i hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a weston in merit , and a churchill in fortune .-- but harriet smith -- i have not half done about harriet smith .  <eos>   has perry seen her ?  <eos>   she hoped they might now become friends again .  <eos>   " i cannot agree with you .  <eos>   and here , instead of its being a matter of condolence , it turns out to be one of congratulation .-- i congratulate you , mr . weston , with all my heart , on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter ."  <eos>   she must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself .  <eos>   " no , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed ."  <eos>   " a new neighbour for us all , miss woodhouse !"  <eos>   she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte , she felt too much in the secret herself , to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair , and therefore purposely kept at a distance ; but by the others , the subject was almost immediately introduced , and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received , the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of " my excellent friend colonel campbell ."  <eos>   she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well .  <eos>   he looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added , " _she_ ought not to be angry with you , i suspect , whatever he may be .-- to that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , emma , that you did want him to marry harriet ."  <eos>   and is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ?  <eos>   said emma , highly amused .--" mr .  <eos>   and mr elliot so anxious that he should !"  <eos>   " about jane fairfax .  <eos>   things must come to a crisis soon now .  <eos>   it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were .-- she should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here .-- he was expected back every day .  <eos>   " no great variety of faces for you ," said emma .  <eos>   it was miss taylor ' s loss which first brought grief .  <eos>   at last it was all settled , even to the destination of the parcel .  <eos>   " that will do ," said he , when it was finished , thinking aloud -- " you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet ."  <eos>   nobody could be so imprudent !  <eos>   " proof indeed !"  <eos>   i feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that i shall soon be abroad .  <eos>   " well , if you give me such kind encouragement , mr . elton , i believe i shall try what i can do .  <eos>   the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter , had proved erroneous ; no friends had deserted them , no pleasures had been lost .-- but her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction .  <eos>   few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did , nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society .  <eos>   " i dare say you would ; but i , simple i , saw nothing but the fact , that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr . dixon caught her .-- it was the work of a moment .  <eos>   and it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though i would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper ."  <eos>   " is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ?"  <eos>   mr . knightley , who had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other .  <eos>   she should then have heard more : mrs . weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge .  <eos>   she would not look again .  <eos>   she bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause .  <eos>   " if we can persuade your father to all this ," said lady russell , looking over her paper , " much may be done .  <eos>   sir walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner ; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention ; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant , on his own terms , and as a great favour , that he would let it at all .  <eos>   " i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr . elton .  <eos>   a word to the wise .-- i am in a fine flow of spirits , an ' t i ?  <eos>   miss nash , head - teacher at mrs . goddard ' s , had written out at least three hundred ; and harriet , who had taken the first hint of it from her , hoped , with miss woodhouse ' s help , to get a great many more .  <eos>   " on this point we have been wretched .  <eos>   i have crossed the atlantic four times , and have been once to the east indies , and back again , and only once ; besides being in different places about home : cork , and lisbon , and gibraltar .  <eos>   well , now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her ."  <eos>   i see no sign of attachment -- i believe nothing of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me that mr . knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax ."  <eos>   did not you observe her manner of answering me ?  <eos>   said she , quickly , looking up in his face .  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   he had never had an idea of throwing himself off ; he had feared that he was thrown off , but knew not why , and delicacy had kept him silent .  <eos>   my only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him .  <eos>   the decree is issued by somebody .  <eos>   she gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child ' s pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them .  <eos>   it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage .  <eos>   lady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before , when a full account of the whole had burst on her ; but still it must be talked of , she must make enquiries , she must regret the imprudence , lament the result , and captain wentworth ' s name must be mentioned by both .  <eos>   " there it is .  <eos>   " well -- as you please ; only don ' t have a great set out .  <eos>   she was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only , " i did not know that proper names were allowed ," pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered .  <eos>   she was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing - room , the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby , under the influence of four summers and two children ; and , on anne ' s appearing , greeted her with --  <eos>   mr . churchill , oh !  <eos>   very unaccountable !  <eos>   i am amused by one part of john ' s letter -- did you notice it ?-- where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind ."  <eos>   " the last time i saw her she had a red nose , but i hope that may not happen every day ."  <eos>   and putting up her hand to screen her words from emma --" a congratulatory visit , you know .-- oh !  <eos>   " when i have seen mr . elton ," replied jane , " i dare say i shall be interested -- but i believe it requires _that_ with me .  <eos>   " that appears quite wonderful .  <eos>   she was good enough for mr . elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for highbury -- handsome enough -- to look plain , probably , by harriet ' s side .  <eos>   one thing more , and all seemed arranged .  <eos>   " quit kellynch hall ."  <eos>   such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by mrs . weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy .-- she had some fears of his horse .  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   i feel that all the apologies should be on my side .  <eos>   " yes , papa , it is written out in our second page .  <eos>   a very few days more , and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch , and mr musgrove had called on him , and come back warm in his praise , and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross , by the end of another week .  <eos>   ."  <eos>   he had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty - four , was still a very fine man .  <eos>   they must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , i do not consider it unwholesome ."  <eos>   " not at all ."  <eos>   you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married ."  <eos>   you will not like staying late .  <eos>   how could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued !  <eos>   at last , and tolerably in his usual tone , he said ,  <eos>   when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle ' s generosity , i am mad with joy : but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her , and how little i deserve to be forgiven , i am mad with anger .  <eos>   we have notice of it in a letter to - day .  <eos>   " no ," said mr . knightley , nearly at the same time ; " you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension .  <eos>   so unlike what a man should be !-- none of that upright integrity , that strict adherence to truth and principle , that disdain of trick and littleness , which a man should display in every transaction of his life ."  <eos>   pray come in ; do come in .  <eos>   " i am most happy to hear it -- but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior !-- and exactly emma ' s age ."  <eos>   emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour .  <eos>   it might be weeks , it might be only a few days , before the horse were useable ; but no preparations could be ventured on , and it was all melancholy stagnation .  <eos>   " if he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man ' s not having it in his power to do as much as that .  <eos>   she is still nearer .-- and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body .  <eos>   i am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting mr . and mrs . cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish .  <eos>   " i do not often walk this way _now_ ," said emma , as they proceeded , " but _then_ there will be an inducement , and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges , gates , pools and pollards of this part of highbury ."  <eos>   emma hoped it must rapidly work harriet ' s cure ; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much .-- it was not to be doubted that poor harriet ' s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve , and her own share in the story , under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him , had in all likelihood been given also .  <eos>   " some very fine morning , he , and emma , and harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with mrs . weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens .  <eos>   it is time for us to be going indeed .  <eos>   he may , at times , be able to do a great deal more than he can at others ."  <eos>   dixon ?"  <eos>   papa is only speaking his own regret ."  <eos>   the first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of jane fairfax .  <eos>   " as to that -- i do not --"  <eos>   ten couple may stand here very well ."  <eos>   i am extremely happy .  <eos>   she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride .  <eos>   " when i talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years ," said john knightley , " i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings .  <eos>   " jane caught a bad cold , poor thing !  <eos>   immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them .  <eos>   you clever creature , that ' s very true .  <eos>   many vain solicitudes would be prevented -- many awkwardnesses smoothed by it .  <eos>   such an aunt !"  <eos>   presently the carriage stopt ; she looked up ; it was stopt by mr . and mrs . weston , who were standing to speak to her .  <eos>   there she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from vicarage lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of -- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no james ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for mr . john knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself .-- but her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .  <eos>   what do you think of him ?  <eos>   do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ?  <eos>   they arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and mr . elton , spruce , black , and smiling , was with them instantly .  <eos>   _she_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings , and trying to understand the degree of her agitation , which she rather thought was considerable .  <eos>   remember how few minutes i was at randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and i am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery .  <eos>   at first , while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver , i saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world .  <eos>   for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken .  <eos>   she thought well of frank in almost every respect ; and , what was more , she loved him very much , and her defence was , therefore , earnest .  <eos>   true affection only could have prompted it ."  <eos>   harriet listened , and emma drew in peace .  <eos>   remember how few minutes i was at randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and i am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery .  <eos>   " very few .  <eos>   while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to anne ' s lot to be placed rather apart with captain benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him .  <eos>   if i draw less , i shall read more ; if i give up music , i shall take to carpet - work .  <eos>   i have spent so many happy months there !  <eos>   she saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for frank churchill at all !  <eos>   and to go home without charles , too , without her husband !  <eos>   " it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four - and - twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount .  <eos>   i do look forward to it , i own , with _very_ great pleasure ."  <eos>   the word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency .  <eos>   he knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away .  <eos>   " i hope you did not venture far , miss fairfax , this morning , or i am sure you must have been wet .-- we scarcely got home in time .  <eos>   time did not compose her .  <eos>   " if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women , and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them , as you are where these children are concerned , we might always think alike ."  <eos>   she would be a loser in every way .  <eos>   she had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather - beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight - and - thirty .  <eos>   certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks -- indescribable spirit ; the idea , the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought , the assurance of his attentions , his liveliness , his manners !  <eos>   " to be sure you did .  <eos>   if any thing , you are too attentive .  <eos>   -- you always called me , ` mr . knightley ;' and , from habit , it has not so very formal a sound .-- and yet it is formal .  <eos>   " is she unwell ?"  <eos>   there was a seriousness in harriet ' s manner which prepared her , quite as much as her words , for something more than ordinary .  <eos>   lively as he was , it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but what decided her belief on the subject , was his staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury .  <eos>   " yes , very true ," cried frank , " very true .  <eos>   however , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife .  <eos>   poor man !-- it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it .  <eos>   " she always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   let every body on the hill hear me if they can .  <eos>   " yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off .  <eos>   i need not tell you what is to be done .  <eos>   " you were living with your husband , and were the only woman on board ."  <eos>   although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , mr . and mrs . weston ' s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune .  <eos>   the toils of the business were over , the sweets began .  <eos>   " they are to be put into mr . weston ' s stable , papa .  <eos>   " you forget how much she belongs to highbury .  <eos>   i wonder how she speaks of the coles -- what she calls them !  <eos>   such a friend as mrs . weston was out of the question .  <eos>   will not it be beautiful in her dark hair ?"  <eos>   there had been music , singing , talking , laughing , all that was most agreeable ; charming manners in captain wentworth , no shyness or reserve ; they seemed all to know each other perfectly , and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with charles .  <eos>   --" she believed he was reckoned a very fine young man ."  <eos>   mr . dixon ' s preference of her music to her friend ' s , i can answer for being very decided ."  <eos>   perry tells me that mr . cole never touches malt liquor .  <eos>   emma grew sick at the sound .  <eos>   is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase ?-- your yorkshire friend -- your correspondent in yorkshire ;-- that would be the way , i suppose , if i were very bad .-- no , i can pronounce his name without the smallest distress .  <eos>   her caution was thrown away .  <eos>   i am sure he has not the least idea of it .  <eos>   my dear isabella , i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr . perry yet ; and he never forgets you ."  <eos>   her influence would have been enough .  <eos>   some scruples and some reluctance the widower - father may be supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome by other considerations , the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills , and he had only his own comfort to seek , and his own situation to improve as he could .  <eos>   but mary did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an elliot , or from not wanting to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed .  <eos>   mary had shewn herself disobliging to him , and was now to reap the consequence , which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch ; and when mary began to complain of it , and lament her being ill - used , according to custom , in being on the hedge side , while anne was never incommoded on the other , he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of , and they could hardly get him along at all .  <eos>   heir to sir walter elliot !  <eos>   captain harville was no reader ; but he had contrived excellent accommodations , and fashioned very pretty shelves , for a tolerable collection of well - bound volumes , the property of captain benwick .  <eos>   troubles soon arose .  <eos>   when the visit was returned , emma made up her mind .  <eos>   " i mentioned no _names_ , you will observe .-- oh !  <eos>   she could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smith ' s .  <eos>   i am quite of your opinion , mrs croft ," was mrs musgrove ' s hearty answer .  <eos>   it stood the record of many sensations of pain , once severe , but now softened ; and of some instances of relenting feeling , some breathings of friendship and reconciliation , which could never be looked for again , and which could never cease to be dear .  <eos>   he was quite delighted .  <eos>   " if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill , i have heard that already ."  <eos>   what shall i say ?"  <eos>   whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine .  <eos>   she was vexed beyond what could have been expressed -- almost beyond what she could conceal .  <eos>   " poor old gentleman ."  <eos>   she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well .  <eos>   i give you this caution now , because i shall never speak to you again on the subject .  <eos>   he brought all the music to her , and they looked it over together .-- emma took the opportunity of whispering ,  <eos>   he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father ' s having any right to complain .  <eos>   or a mermaid ?  <eos>   " nonsense !  <eos>   well , ( returning to the room ,) i have not been able to succeed .  <eos>   well , sir , the time must come when you will be paid for all this , when you will have little labour and great enjoyment ."  <eos>   but i think , my dear , you said you had got it ."  <eos>   well , frank , your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent .  <eos>   though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after mr and mrs musgrove ' s going than anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to uppercross they drove over to the lodge .  <eos>   for myself , i protest i must be excused ," said mrs . elton ; " _i_ really cannot attempt -- i am not at all fond of the sort of thing .  <eos>   she came solitarily down the gravel walk -- a miss martin just appearing at the door , and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility .  <eos>   indeed , miss woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly ,) with the consciousness which i have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to -- i have not time for half that i could wish to say .  <eos>   it used to stand here .  <eos>   pray , what would become of us poor sailors ' wives , who often want to be conveyed to one port or another , after our husbands , if everybody had your feelings ?"  <eos>   kellynch hall was to be let .  <eos>   " well -- if you advise it .-- but ( with a smile ) if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall i say ?  <eos>   " middling , my dear ; i cannot compliment you .  <eos>   she had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should .  <eos>   " and i , mr . knightley , am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm .  <eos>   had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison .-- she saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider mr . knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear .  <eos>   mr . elton returned , a very happy man .  <eos>   my dear admiral , that post !  <eos>   she was out ; and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in .  <eos>   " i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , mr . knightley , if i take the liberty ( i consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma ' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smith ' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you .  <eos>   " i am disappointed ," was his only answer .  <eos>   in half a minute they were together .  <eos>   one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one ' s own .  <eos>   she must be collected and calm .  <eos>   the real evils , indeed , of emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments .  <eos>   she had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause .  <eos>   i do not know what he would be at .  <eos>   ma ' am ," addressing her , " do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane ' s handwriting ?"  <eos>   there was no denying that those brothers had penetration .  <eos>   upon the whole , she was equally contented with her view of his feelings .  <eos>   with great indignation did he continue to observe him ; with great alarm and distrust , to observe also his two blinded companions .  <eos>   one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other ."  <eos>   " my poor dear harriet !  <eos>   their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane , a lane leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular , main street of the place ; and , as may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of mr . elton .  <eos>   he is desperately in love and means to marry her ."  <eos>   miss woodhouse , how ungrateful i have been !"  <eos>   our part of london is very superior to most others !-- you must not confound us with london in general , my dear sir .  <eos>   " do not you think , miss woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered ?-- do not you think her cure does perry the highest credit ?--( here was a side - glance of great meaning at jane .)  <eos>   you would have doated on her , had you gone .-- but not a word more .  <eos>   " was he agreeable ?"  <eos>   ` oh !'  <eos>   hazle eyes excepted , two years more might make her all that he wished .  <eos>   i perfectly understand your situation , however , miss woodhouse -- ( looking towards mr . woodhouse ), your father ' s state of health must be a great drawback .  <eos>   " yes , here i am , sophia , quite ready to make a foolish match .  <eos>   now , it would be really having frank in their neighbourhood .  <eos>   " was he agreeable ?"  <eos>   i am almost ashamed to say it ."  <eos>   he was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered .  <eos>   " i am glad you think so ; and the good hands , i hope , may not be wanting ."  <eos>   i had not recollected it before , i declare , but it must be very bad .  <eos>   i will take it home with me at night ."  <eos>   but i never have been in love ; it is not my way , or my nature ; and i do not think i ever shall .  <eos>   yes , very .  <eos>   " if i made myself intelligible yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected or not , i know it will be read with candour and indulgence .-- you are all goodness , and i believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct .-- but i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent .  <eos>   it was a very extraordinary thing !  <eos>   " my mother ' s deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all .  <eos>   as she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from mrs . goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring miss smith with her ; a most welcome request : for miss smith was a girl of seventeen , whom emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty .  <eos>   knightley must not marry !-- you would not have little henry cut out from donwell ?-- oh !  <eos>   mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming mrs charles musgrove ; but anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister ; her word had no weight , her convenience was always to give way -- she was only anne .  <eos>   captain benwick must give up his room to them , and get another bed elsewhere ; and the whole was settled .  <eos>   no -- what an impudent dog i was !-- how could i dare --"  <eos>   but i cannot believe it of you .  <eos>   i have read worse charades .  <eos>   he has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .  <eos>   mr . elton must now be left to himself .  <eos>   " to be sure we do ," cried his father ; " mrs . bates -- we passed her house -- i saw miss bates at the window .  <eos>   at first it was downright dulness to emma .  <eos>   the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion .  <eos>   " you were mentioning may .  <eos>   mr . elton ' s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr . martin .  <eos>   emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr . martin ' s prose .  <eos>   anne presumed , however , still to smile about it , and at last to mention " elizabeth ."  <eos>   mr . weston ' s ball was to be a real thing .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   as she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied ,  <eos>   the heat was excessive ; he had never suffered any thing like it -- almost wished he had staid at home -- nothing killed him like heat -- he could bear any degree of cold , etc ., but heat was intolerable -- and he sat down , at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr . woodhouse ' s fire , looking very deplorable .  <eos>   mrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   she was put down in camden place ; and lady russell then drove to her own lodgings , in rivers street .  <eos>   i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , emma .  <eos>   i have not seen a creature the whole morning !"  <eos>   how else could they come ?"  <eos>   emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriet ' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of mr . elton ' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriet ' s side , as there could be any occasion for .  <eos>   " you are prepared for the worst , i see -- and very bad it is .  <eos>   may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at randalls , but at the crown inn ?"  <eos>   but now , another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these .  <eos>   anne avoided a direct reply , but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated , but as what ought to be suppressed .  <eos>   nothing hastily done ; nothing incomplete .  <eos>   he could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body ' s returning into their proper place the next morning .  <eos>   neither would mr . knightley ' s downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _him_ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable .  <eos>   the sight of mrs clay in such favour , and of anne so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed .  <eos>   the following day brought news from richmond to throw every thing else into the background .  <eos>   you are very obliging to say such things -- but certainly not .  <eos>   now , according to my idea of mrs . churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all ."  <eos>   the affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of miss campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of jane ' s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements .  <eos>   she had talked her into love ; but , alas !  <eos>   but mrs . dixon must be very much disappointed .  <eos>   " nothing can be going on better than the child ," said he ; " so i told my father , just now , that i would come , and he thought me quite right .  <eos>   what can you possibly have to do ?"  <eos>   the conclusion of the whole was , that if the woman who had been sensible of captain wentworth ' s merits could be allowed to prefer another man , there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder ; and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it , certainly nothing to be regretted .  <eos>   she left it to himself to recollect , that mrs smith was not the only widow in bath between thirty and forty , with little to live on , and no surname of dignity .  <eos>   she only knew that henrietta was at home again ; and that louisa , though considered to be recovering fast , was still in lyme ; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening , when a thicker letter than usual from mary was delivered to her ; and , to quicken the pleasure and surprise , with admiral and mrs croft ' s compliments .  <eos>   he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms .  <eos>   you shall have a charming wife ."  <eos>   he was either less disposed for it than charles had imagined , or he was too shy ; and after giving him a week ' s indulgence , lady russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite .  <eos>   harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances .-- emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation .  <eos>   he talks of you ," cried charles , " in such terms --" mary interrupted him .  <eos>   your description of mrs . churchill made me think of them directly .  <eos>   " i should not wonder ," said mrs . weston , " if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt ' s eagerness in accepting mrs . elton ' s civilities for her .  <eos>   now mary , i declare it was so , i heard it myself , and you were in the other room .  <eos>   you left nothing undone .  <eos>   " there is one thing , emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution .  <eos>   such an aunt !"  <eos>   papa , we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married .  <eos>   he paused .-- she coloured and laughed .--" i know you saw my letter , and think you may remember my wish in your favour .  <eos>   every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home .  <eos>   the wonder was , how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did , so long !  <eos>   you are afraid of giving me trouble ; but i assure you , my dear jane , the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am .  <eos>   charles ' s attentions to henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation .  <eos>   mr . perry had been to mrs . goddard ' s to attend a sick child , and miss nash had seen him , and he had told miss nash , that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park , he had met mr . elton , and found to his great surprize , that mr . elton was actually on his road to london , and not meaning to return till the morrow , though it was the whist - club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and mr . perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ; mr . elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious .  <eos>   " quite out of the question , quite out of the question ," he replied ;-- " but you must often wish it , i am sure ."  <eos>   they were all at her disposal .  <eos>   how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ?  <eos>   " low , i am afraid , sir , very low ," answered his son ;--" but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way ."  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   such scarecrows as the streets were full of !  <eos>   what years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him !-- assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for jane fairfax ' s character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour ,-- equality of situation -- i mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one -- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants .-- a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _her_ regard , must , i think , be the happiest of mortals .-- frank churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune .  <eos>   it included nearly a third part of her own life .  <eos>   i want to see you permanently well connected , and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , i say that if you should still be in this country when mr . martin marries , i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters , to be acquainted with the wife , who will probably be some mere farmer ' s daughter , without education ."  <eos>   now i say , my dear , in _our_ case , for _lady_ , read ---- mum !  <eos>   " and i am sure i should never want to go there ; for i am never happy but at hartfield ."  <eos>   here were funds of enjoyment .  <eos>   had i done as i ought !  <eos>   something occurred while they were at hartfield , to make emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave .  <eos>   the hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and emma sat down to think and be miserable .-- it was a wretched business indeed !-- such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for !-- such a development of every thing most unwelcome !-- such a blow for harriet !-- that was the worst of all .  <eos>   i have had all my own little concerns to arrange , books and music to divide , and all my trunks to repack , from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons : and one thing i have had to do , mary , of a more trying nature : going to almost every house in the parish , as a sort of take - leave .  <eos>   there is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party .  <eos>   " perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut ."  <eos>   " i am going to kingston .  <eos>   it was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it :-- elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in highbury .  <eos>   after some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank mrs . weston , look sorrowful , and have done .  <eos>   very delightful indeed ; i can say nothing less , for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr . frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes .  <eos>   the change on mrs . elton ' s side soon afterwards appeared , and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of mrs . elton , nor , under mrs . elton ' s guidance , the very active patroness of jane fairfax , and only sharing with others in a general way , in knowing what was felt , what was meditated , what was done .  <eos>   i do congratulate you , mrs . weston , most warmly .  <eos>   i never could comprehend how mr . weston could part with him .  <eos>   you are very obliging to say such things -- but certainly not .  <eos>   she must have been a perpetual enemy .  <eos>   emma could not have a better companion than harriet ."  <eos>   " why , pretty well ; but not quite well .  <eos>   there are secrets in all families , you know )-- the case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january ; and that frank ' s coming depends upon their being put off .  <eos>   he loves any thing of the sort , and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment .  <eos>   mrs . weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that emma ' s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said ,  <eos>   miss hamilton , now mrs smith , had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable .  <eos>   mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot ' s knock ."  <eos>   in a low , cautious voice , he said : --  <eos>   miss woodhouse , how kind you are !-- i suppose you have heard -- and are come to give us joy .  <eos>   we shall only be making each other more angry .  <eos>   i have been always telling you , my love , that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have emma ' s account , i hope you will be satisfied ."  <eos>   however , when i read on , i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first ; and i make so light of it now to her , that she does not think much about it .  <eos>   i could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as mr . weston came into the room , and i could get at him , i spoke to him about the carriage .  <eos>   when the evening was over , anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination .  <eos>   excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , i can see nothing unsuitable ."  <eos>   her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour .  <eos>   said mr . woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; " then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady .  <eos>   " well , i have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever i marry , i hope some body will chuse my wife for me .  <eos>   " were you really ?-- well !-- but you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you .-- if i had been there , i think i should have made some discoveries ."  <eos>   " poor dear fellow !"  <eos>   i have not nerves for the sort of thing ."  <eos>   henrietta , conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin charles walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as mary wished ; but " no !"  <eos>   the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined , but he was at highbury very soon afterwards .  <eos>   you clever creature , that ' s very true .  <eos>   john , the second , is named after his father .  <eos>   -- and as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth .  <eos>   it must , if i were not here .  <eos>   " he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from knightley ; but he and knightley are shut up together in deep consultation .-- mr .  <eos>   on tuesday night , he made a very awkward sort of excuse ; ` he never shot ' and he had ` been quite misunderstood ,' and he had promised this and he had promised that , and the end of it was , i found , that he did not mean to come .  <eos>   " yes ; you see his papa can , and why should not i ?  <eos>   i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour .  <eos>   he was often hoping , intending to come -- but was always prevented .  <eos>   gone to mr . woodhouse ' s .  <eos>   i am quite enough in love .  <eos>   and here i can admit , that my manners to miss w ., in being unpleasant to miss f ., were highly blameable .  <eos>   her next beginning was ,  <eos>   mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister ' s account ; but , however , louisa is a great favourite with both .  <eos>   he contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till jane fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again .  <eos>   you are extremely troublesome .  <eos>   the evil of the actual disparity in their ages ( and mr . woodhouse had not married early ) was much increased by his constitution and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his life , without activity of mind or body , he was a much older man in ways than in years ; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not have recommended him at any time .  <eos>   i do not know what he would be at .  <eos>   i had no intention , i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes , when i first entered the house .  <eos>   if we were all like you , i believe we might sit four .  <eos>   it was felt as such things must be felt .  <eos>   such personal praise might have struck her , especially as it did not appear to anne that the freckles were at all lessened .  <eos>   other poultry - yards in the neighbourhood also suffered .-- pilfering was _housebreaking_ to mr . woodhouse ' s fears .-- he was very uneasy ; and but for the sense of his son - in - law ' s protection , would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life .  <eos>   she cried in evident embarrassment , " it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves ."  <eos>   ah !  <eos>   dear emma has been to call on mrs . and miss bates , mr . knightley , as i told you before .  <eos>   his situation is an evil -- but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend ; and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more .  <eos>   " well ," said she to herself , " this is most strange !-- after i had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave harriet ill behind !-- most strange indeed !-- but there is , i believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination -- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with mr . elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with harriet ; but still , he cannot refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked .  <eos>   she was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt jane fairfax ' s feelings ; and they followed the other ladies out of the room , arm in arm , with an appearance of good - will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each .  <eos>   they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley ' s .  <eos>   mr . knightley , who had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other .  <eos>   " and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while ; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure ."  <eos>   " what an excellent device ," said he , " the use of a sheepskin for carriages .  <eos>   " you are right , mrs . weston ," said mr . knightley warmly , " miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs . elton .  <eos>   " you mean to return a favourable answer , i collect ."  <eos>   i do not reckon the hayters as anybody .  <eos>   emma ' s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law ' s breaking out .  <eos>   " i cannot rate her beauty as you do ," said he ; " but she is a pretty little creature , and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition .  <eos>   they were now able to speak to each other and consult .  <eos>   you will soon , i earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself .-- no description can describe her .  <eos>   " yes ," he replied , and without the smallest apparent embarrassment .-- " but they would have done better had they given her notice of it .  <eos>   he was gone the next moment :-- after another moment ' s pause ,  <eos>   we have nothing clever to say -- not one of us .  <eos>   harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party .  <eos>   she is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up .-- there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune .-- her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort .-- that she is a gentleman ' s daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen ' s daughters , no one , i apprehend , will deny .-- she is superior to mr . robert martin ."  <eos>   that is a great thing .  <eos>   should not this be enough for a sailor , who has had no society among women to make him nice ?"  <eos>   they would be married , and settled either at or near enscombe .  <eos>   think , then , what i must have endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority .  <eos>   " i mean to go with you , charles , for i am of no more use at home than you are .  <eos>   i would be understood to mean , that it can be only weak , irresolute characters , ( whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance ,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience , an oppression for ever ."  <eos>   emma ' s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at mr .  <eos>   i thought you had lost half your property , at least .  <eos>   for shame !"  <eos>   " it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield .  <eos>   the distressing explanation she had to make to harriet , and all that poor harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully .  <eos>   emma did not want to be classed with the mrs . eltons , the mrs . perrys , and the mrs . coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself -- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned miss bates farther as to her niece ' s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist .  <eos>   here is a nut ," said he , catching one down from an upper bough .  <eos>   it was growing quite dusk , however , before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross , and there had been total silence among them for some time , henrietta leaning back in the corner , with a shawl over her face , giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep ; when , as they were going up their last hill , anne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth .  <eos>   it was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue .  <eos>   the mr musgroves had their own game to guard , and to destroy , their own horses , dogs , and newspapers to engage them , and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping , neighbours , dress , dancing , and music .  <eos>   said emma .  <eos>   jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off .  <eos>   i smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect ; but at present i do not see what there is to question .  <eos>   " why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole .  <eos>   they were all three walking about together for an hour or two -- first round the shrubberies of hartfield , and afterwards in highbury .  <eos>   jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state .  <eos>   upon such occasions poor mr . woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare .  <eos>   it was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain charles hayter returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think captain wentworth very much in the way .  <eos>   " i know how highly you think of jane fairfax ," said emma .  <eos>   " my dear miss fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for .-- i hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well .  <eos>   " it is odd though ," observed his father , " that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe .  <eos>   a complete change of life became desirable .  <eos>   poverty certainly has not contracted her mind : i really believe , if she had only a shilling in the world , she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it ; and nobody is afraid of her : that is a great charm ."  <eos>   after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr . and mrs . suckling , the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn .  <eos>   the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from mr . elton to mr . woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with mr . elton ' s best compliments , " that he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of mr . woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense -- and had mr . woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them ."  <eos>   she went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after box hill , when poor jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected .-- the fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name .-- she heard patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss bates had before made so happily intelligible .-- no ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , " beg her to walk up ;"-- and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient .-- emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging .  <eos>   he may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it ."  <eos>   it ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency .  <eos>   well , what do you say to it ?-- i always told you he would be here again soon , did not i ?-- anne , my dear , did not i always tell you so , and you would not believe me ?-- in town next week , you see -- at the latest , i dare say ; for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or saturday .  <eos>   chapter xvii  <eos>   was mr . woodhouse ' s first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time .  <eos>   jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state .  <eos>   there is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them .  <eos>   " not quite ," returned emma , with forced calmness , " for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person .  <eos>   anne listened , but without quite understanding it .  <eos>   the miss hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for henrietta and louisa , they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good - will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals .  <eos>   all this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the eltons ' departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending .  <eos>   they were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money , and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father ; but here , as on most topics , he had the superiority , for while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made , he always contended for his father ' s having many other uses for his money , and a right to spend it as he liked .  <eos>   he had been there for four - and - twenty hours .  <eos>   they walked on .  <eos>   " never , never !"  <eos>   her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with .  <eos>   i hope you are quite well .  <eos>   if _we_ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations .  <eos>   will that do ?  <eos>   this was very wonderful if it were true ; and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot , already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to mary , of his being " a man whom she had no wish to see ."  <eos>   she was now met by mrs .  <eos>   a letter from his friend , captain harville , having found him out at last , had brought intelligence of captain harville ' s being settled with his family at lyme for the winter ; of their being therefore , quite unknowingly , within twenty miles of each other .  <eos>   he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long , and which had been the home of his father ' s father ; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living , walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other ; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit , they shewed , altogether , a good - will towards highbury in general , which must be very like a merit to those he was with .  <eos>   " we will not allow her to do such a thing again :"-- and nodding significantly --" there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed .  <eos>   well , that is so very !-- i am sure if jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm .-- mr .  <eos>   since he actually was expected in the country , she must teach herself to be insensible on such points .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented , she was soon spared all suspense ; for , after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary : --  <eos>   this was sir walter and elizabeth ' s share of interest in the letter ; when mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove , and her fine little boys , anne was at liberty .  <eos>   it is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , i suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , miss woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune --( again dispersing her tears )-- but , poor dear soul !  <eos>   even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it .  <eos>   he seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her .  <eos>   my blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of , and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier ."  <eos>   her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected .  <eos>   i saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other ."  <eos>   she will break it to you better than i can .  <eos>   she had heard , as soon as she got back to mrs . goddard ' s , that mr . martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from mr . martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage .  <eos>   it seems an impossibility !-- you cannot mean to say , that harriet smith has accepted robert martin .  <eos>   he re - urged -- she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it --  <eos>   " middling , my dear ; i cannot compliment you .  <eos>   but if she continued to play whenever she was asked by mr . dixon , one may guess what one chuses ."  <eos>   cried he , catching the same tone ; " i honour you !"  <eos>   the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were , that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome , hopeless son ; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year ; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore ; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family , though quite as much as he deserved ; seldom heard of , and scarcely at all regretted , when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross , two years before .  <eos>   i am sure of having their opinions with me ."  <eos>   isabella and emma , i think , do write very much alike .  <eos>   when they came to converse , she was soon sensible of some mental change .  <eos>   nothing seemed amiss on the side of the great house family , which was generally , as anne very well knew , the least to blame .  <eos>   " it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined !  <eos>   " you will excuse my being so much over - powered .  <eos>   anne ' s shudderings were to herself alone ; but the miss musgroves could be as open as they were sincere , in their exclamations of pity and horror .  <eos>   it was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if perry had seen it ."  <eos>   the hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and emma sat down to think and be miserable .-- it was a wretched business indeed !-- such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for !-- such a development of every thing most unwelcome !-- such a blow for harriet !-- that was the worst of all .  <eos>   half the sum of attraction , on either side , might have been enough , for he had nothing to do , and she had hardly anybody to love ; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   they had not a fault to find in him .  <eos>   to talk would be only to irritate .-- she wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday .-- harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful .  <eos>   i grant you , that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta , and indeed it could not be ; he is the only one that could be possible ; but he is a very good - natured , good sort of a fellow ; and whenever winthrop comes into his hands , he will make a different sort of place of it , and live in a very different sort of way ; and with that property , he will never be a contemptible man -- good , freehold property .  <eos>   i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs . cole told us of it at dinner ."  <eos>   chapter viii  <eos>   " till i have a letter from colonel campbell ," said she , in a voice of forced calmness , " i can imagine nothing with any confidence .  <eos>   " there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be .  <eos>   i treat you without ceremony , mr . knightley .  <eos>   he agreed to it , but with so quiet a " yes ," as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if jane fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it .  <eos>   mary talked , but she could not attend .  <eos>   she rose early , and wrote her letter to harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that mr . knightley , in walking up to hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before .  <eos>   no indeed i am not ."  <eos>   they went in ; and while the sleek , well - tied parcels of " men ' s beavers " and " york tan " were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said --" but i beg your pardon , miss woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_ .  <eos>   you saw her with the campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on .  <eos>   mr . perry is not gone ."  <eos>   late hours do not agree with us .  <eos>   happy creature !  <eos>   " oh !"  <eos>   emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced mr . dixon ' s actions from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first .  <eos>   i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else ."  <eos>   in each letter he had spoken well of his captain ; but yet , so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters , so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships , that it had made scarcely any impression at the time ; and that mrs musgrove should have been suddenly struck , this very day , with a recollection of the name of wentworth , as connected with her son , seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur .  <eos>   " but you , who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger , surely ?"  <eos>   for the very moment mr . cole told mrs . cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me .  <eos>   he must know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family -- and that the eltons were nobody .  <eos>   " it might be distressing , for the moment ," said she ; " but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never -- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it ."  <eos>   it was her superior duty .  <eos>   he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived .  <eos>   and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with anne , to say , " oh !  <eos>   only three of us .-- besides dear jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it .  <eos>   you would have doated on her , had you gone .-- but not a word more .  <eos>   he has walked with me , sometimes , from one end of the sands to the other , without saying a word .  <eos>   your sister being with you , my love , i have no scruple at all .  <eos>   yes , i see what she means , ( turning to mr . knightley ,) and i will try to hold my tongue .  <eos>   in any other place sir walter might judge for himself ; and would be looked up to , as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household ."  <eos>   i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury , as they can be to see her .  <eos>   papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ?"  <eos>   i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning ."  <eos>   i am sure i do not know ."  <eos>   the difference of harriet at mrs . goddard ' s , or in london , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emma ' s sensations ; but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself .  <eos>   i do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family , and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them .  <eos>   here mr . weston joined them , and on hearing what was proposed , gave it his decided approbation .  <eos>   i do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries ."  <eos>   perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy .  <eos>   " now , ma ' am ," said jane to her aunt , " shall we join mrs .  <eos>   say ` no ,' if it is to be said ."  <eos>   his importance at enscombe was very evident .  <eos>   what years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him !-- assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for jane fairfax ' s character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour ,-- equality of situation -- i mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one -- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants .-- a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _her_ regard , must , i think , be the happiest of mortals .-- frank churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune .  <eos>   for shame !"  <eos>   it was a right thing to do .  <eos>   " i know there is such an idea with many people , but indeed it is quite a mistake , sir .-- we all had our health perfectly well there , never found the least inconvenience from the mud ; and mr . wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy ; and i am sure he may be depended on , for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air , and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly ."  <eos>   there are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- offices for the sale -- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect ."  <eos>   .  <eos>   the picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon after mr . elton ' s return , and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting - room , he got up to look at it , and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as for harriet ' s feelings , they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted .  <eos>   mr . weston might be his son ' s superior .-- in spite of this little rub , however , emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her .-- she was more disturbed by mr . knightley ' s not dancing than by any thing else .-- there he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing ,-- not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up ,-- so young as he looked !-- he could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself .  <eos>   " well , my dear ," he deliberately began , " considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and i dare say she was very much pleased with you .  <eos>   be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children , and let me look as i chuse ."  <eos>   he was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed .  <eos>   there was a little blush , and then this answer ,  <eos>   selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better ."  <eos>   " i think lady russell would like him .  <eos>   " indeed !-- from yorkshire , i think .  <eos>   " here is his answer , if you like to see it ."  <eos>   she was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers .  <eos>   this decision checked mary ' s eagerness , and stopped her short in the midst of the elliot countenance .  <eos>   it seemed as if mr shepherd , in this anxiety to bespeak sir walter ' s good will towards a naval officer as tenant , had been gifted with foresight ; for the very first application for the house was from an admiral croft , with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton ; and indeed , he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent .  <eos>   " yes , our good mrs . elton .  <eos>   " i am ,"-- she answered --" i am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me .-- miss woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits .  <eos>   " did you ever have your likeness taken , harriet ?"  <eos>   we have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely .  <eos>   but the expression is hardly admissible , mrs . weston , is it ?  <eos>   nobody could nurse her , as we should do ."  <eos>   well , i wish them happy with all my heart .  <eos>   i never compliment .  <eos>   she replied with a smile of astonishment , " are you imagining me to be mr . elton ' s object ?"  <eos>   referring the education to her seemed to imply it .  <eos>   " it is certainly very well regulated ."  <eos>   -- but with many , many thanks --` there was no occasion to trouble us , for mr . knightley ' s carriage had brought , and was to take them home again .'  <eos>   he had called in camden place ; had called a second time , a third ; had been pointedly attentive .  <eos>   emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted .  <eos>   while he staid , the martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again , emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return elizabeth martin ' s visit .  <eos>   the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else .  <eos>   he was steady , observant , moderate , candid ; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness , which fancied itself strong feeling ; and yet , with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely , and a value for all the felicities of domestic life , which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess .  <eos>   " well ," said anne , " i certainly am proud , too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place ."  <eos>   the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do .  <eos>   she had suffered very much from cramp after dancing , and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless -- and in this state , and exceedingly terrified , she had been obliged to remain .  <eos>   my father ' s next heir ?  <eos>   dear me !  <eos>   mrs . cole had many to agree with her ; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell , and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made ; and there were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way , and still listen to mrs . cole .  <eos>   it is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , i suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , miss woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune --( again dispersing her tears )-- but , poor dear soul !  <eos>   " i cannot rate her beauty as you do ," said he ; " but she is a pretty little creature , and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition .  <eos>   that will be a much better thing .  <eos>   serle understands boiling an egg better than any body .  <eos>   anne , have you courage to go with me , and pay a visit in that house ?  <eos>   she believed every body found his manners pleasing ."  <eos>   it is a certainty .  <eos>   i knew how it would be .  <eos>   she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her ;-- _she_ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner ,  <eos>   " my dear , how am i to get so far ?  <eos>   as the blow was given , emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell .  <eos>   " there were misunderstandings between them , emma ; he said so expressly .  <eos>   i believe you were glad we danced no longer ; but i would have given worlds -- all the worlds one ever has to give -- for another half - hour ."  <eos>   i cannot let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse .-- but i never have ."  <eos>   and in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and emma was quite in charity with him .  <eos>   somebody had placed her , several years back , at mrs . goddard ' s school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder .  <eos>   " then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her .  <eos>   he could not understand it ; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least -- symptoms of admiration on his side , which , having once observed , he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish to escape any of emma ' s errors of imagination .  <eos>   he had always been lucky ; he knew he should be so still .  <eos>   i remember it was written from weymouth , and dated sept . 28th -- and began , ` my dear madam ,' but i forget how it went on ; and it was signed ` f . c . weston churchill .'  <eos>   and ever since she was twelve , emma has been mistress of the house and of you all .  <eos>   i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning ."  <eos>   " i was with mr . cole on business an hour and a half ago .  <eos>   delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and mrs . elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately .-- on her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend ' s negative , though miss fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before .-- still mrs . elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow ' s post .-- how jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to emma .-- she did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal .-- " should not they walk ?  <eos>   she remembered what mr . knightley had once said to her about mr . elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that mr . elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself .  <eos>   " and , upon my word , they have an air of great probability .  <eos>   consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know .  <eos>   i suppose " ( smiling ) " i have more pride than any of you ; but i confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them ."  <eos>   frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax .  <eos>   when the campbells are returned , we shall meet them in london , and continue there , i trust , till we may carry her northward .-- but now , i am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard , miss woodhouse ?-- till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation .  <eos>   " the shame ," he answered , " is all mine , or ought to be .  <eos>   and , pray , who is charles hayter ?  <eos>   " wentworth was the very name !  <eos>   are you in any doubt as to that ?  <eos>   " i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill ," was charles ' s language ; and , in an unhappy mood , thus spoke mary : " i do believe if charles were to see me dying , he would not think there was anything the matter with me .  <eos>   she promised to think of it , and advised him to think of it more ; but he was fully convinced , that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject .  <eos>   he looked , as he spoke , to the seat which mrs clay had been lately occupying : a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant ; and though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride , she was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay ; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father ' s getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her .  <eos>   there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest , and it caught emma ' s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind .  <eos>   to complete every other recommendation , he had _almost_ told her that he loved her .  <eos>   " i cannot rate her beauty as you do ," said he ; " but she is a pretty little creature , and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition .  <eos>   " how sorry i am !  <eos>   " he has been wanting to come to us ," continued mr . weston , " ever since september : every letter has been full of it ; but he cannot command his own time .  <eos>   i have often talked to her a good deal .  <eos>   in fact , it does not concern you -- it concerns only myself ,-- that is , we hope .-- humph !-- in short , my dear emma , there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it .  <eos>   we have notice of it in a letter to - day .  <eos>   " i do not think it will ," stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place , and recall the still greater within .  <eos>   but mr . elton , in person , had driven away all such cares .  <eos>   if he had but asked who the party were !  <eos>   he thought it a very degrading alliance ; and lady russell , though with more tempered and pardonable pride , received it as a most unfortunate one .  <eos>   but mr . woodhouse -- how was mr . woodhouse to be induced to consent ?-- he , who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event .  <eos>   " how delighted i am to see you again !  <eos>   " if we can persuade your father to all this ," said lady russell , looking over her paper , " much may be done .  <eos>   there will not be time for any thing ."  <eos>   you will like harriet .  <eos>   i am not at all equal to it .  <eos>   she had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period .  <eos>   i should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and i cannot help beginning ."  <eos>   when the evening was over , anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination .  <eos>   it could be protracted no longer .  <eos>   every body must have seen the snow coming on .  <eos>   " and do you see her , sir , tolerably often ?"  <eos>   you will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , i am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue ."  <eos>   when he was speaking of it in that way , i honestly said that _the_ _world_ i could give up -- parties , balls , plays -- for i had no fear of retirement .  <eos>   " one ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but enscombe , i believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _she_ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her ."  <eos>   it would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- i do not know that -- i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well ."  <eos>   in her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her .  <eos>   this was mr . elton !  <eos>   oh , no !  <eos>   she roused herself to say , as they struck by order into another path , " is not this one of the ways to winthrop ?"  <eos>   they would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims .  <eos>   " i know you , i know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but i shall be a little more nice , and i am sure the good campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle .  <eos>   but this was not judged feasible .  <eos>   emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a " very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter ."  <eos>   " but what are you in doubt of ?  <eos>   nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own .  <eos>   it is remarkable , that emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded .  <eos>   with men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works ."  <eos>   he felt it all , so much for her sake .  <eos>   her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _was_ good enough .  <eos>   but his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the campbells , he named the name of dixon .-- emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing .  <eos>   you shall have a charming wife ."  <eos>   a bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may ."  <eos>   emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort .  <eos>   harriet was to sit again the next day ; and mr . elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again .  <eos>   she expressed herself most willing , ready , happy to remain .  <eos>   " it would be very hard upon mr . weston if she did not , papa .-- you quite forget poor mr .  <eos>   there was merit in every drawing -- in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same .  <eos>   miss woodhouse , i would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly .  <eos>   i am sorry for it .  <eos>   in mourning , you see , just as our mr elliot must be .  <eos>   she believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for mr . perry .  <eos>   emma , i must tell you what you will not ask , though i may wish it unsaid the next moment ."  <eos>   she could not , however , reach such a degree of certainty , as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house , where the crofts had previously been calling .  <eos>   emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour .  <eos>   " you are comfortable because you are under command ."  <eos>   nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future .  <eos>   it was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making light of what ought to be serious , a trick of what ought to be simple .  <eos>   when a gallant young man , like mr . frank churchill ," said mr . knightley dryly , " writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best ."  <eos>   here and there , human nature may be great in times of trial ; but generally speaking , it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber : it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude , that one hears of .  <eos>   jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice ,  <eos>   i think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him ."  <eos>   " so very obliging of you !-- no rain at all .  <eos>   he was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven .  <eos>   one cannot love a reserved person ."  <eos>   " that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast , of my present perfect indifference ," she continued , " i will farther tell you , that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance , when i did like him , when i was very much disposed to be attached to him -- nay , was attached -- and how it came to cease , is perhaps the wonder .  <eos>   for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken .  <eos>   " dating from three o ' clock yesterday .  <eos>   she is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information .  <eos>   isabella and emma , i think , do write very much alike .  <eos>   you may believe me , mrs . weston .  <eos>   but when satisfied on all these points , and their acquaintance proportionably advanced , he contrived to find an opportunity , while their two fathers were engaged with each other , of introducing his mother - in - law , and speaking of her with so much handsome praise , so much warm admiration , so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father , and her very kind reception of himself , as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please -- and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her .  <eos>   she is nothing to me , compared with you ;" and she was in full time to hear her father say , " my dear madam , this must not be .  <eos>   they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter .  <eos>   but why so ?-- i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too ."  <eos>   if mr . elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine harriet ' s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him .  <eos>   " what does all that signify ?  <eos>   why does not perry see her ?"  <eos>   the scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; mrs . weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into highbury ;-- to hartfield of course .  <eos>   emma looked at her , quite unable to speak .  <eos>   knightley !-- how she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it !-- but harriet was less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly .-- her inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little felt .-- she had seemed more sensible of mr . elton ' s being to stoop in marrying her , than she now seemed of mr .  <eos>   they are as fine healthy children as ever were seen , poor little dears !  <eos>   he is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering jane fairfax ' s ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him ;-- and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr . knightley .  <eos>   it was a very fine november day , and the miss musgroves came through the little grounds , and stopped for no other purpose than to say , that they were going to take a long walk , and therefore concluded mary could not like to go with them ; and when mary immediately replied , with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker , " oh , yes , i should like to join you very much , i am very fond of a long walk ;" anne felt persuaded , by the looks of the two girls , that it was precisely what they did not wish , and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce , of everything being to be communicated , and everything being to be done together , however undesired and inconvenient .  <eos>   anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different .  <eos>   so far went his understanding ; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing , in the admiral ' s situation in life , which was just high enough , and not too high .  <eos>   but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own .  <eos>   he had left them completely frightened ; and harriet eagerly clinging to him , and hardly able to speak , had just strength enough to reach hartfield , before her spirits were quite overcome .  <eos>   indeed , when the time draws on , i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable .  <eos>   he is an excellent young man , and will suit harriet exactly ; it will be an ` exactly so ,' as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than i could endure as a principal .  <eos>   " but you , who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger , surely ?"  <eos>   you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here .  <eos>   but about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr . perry ; i happened to meet him in the street .  <eos>   but the sight of mr . knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half emma ' s mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of mrs . weston ' s suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions .  <eos>   we shall only be making each other more angry .  <eos>   and it will not be very long , i hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason .-- fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled !-- i could never , i confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt -- i could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which i never believed him to deserve .-- he is a disgrace to the name of man .-- and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman ?-- jane , jane , you will be a miserable creature ."  <eos>   only give me a carte - blanche .-- i am lady patroness , you know .  <eos>   " it is not fair ," said emma , in a whisper ; " mine was a random guess .  <eos>   she wanted her to be more known .  <eos>   .  <eos>   and poor john ' s son came to talk to mr . elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he cannot keep his father without some help ; and so , when mr . elton came back , he told us what john ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr . frank churchill to richmond .  <eos>   " so prettily done !  <eos>   " i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother , but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sick - room than charles , for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if i told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about .  <eos>   " i hope he will be here to - morrow , for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence .  <eos>   " yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london .  <eos>   " charles may say what he pleases ," cried mary to anne , as soon as he was out of the room , " but it would be shocking to have henrietta marry charles hayter ; a very bad thing for her , and still worse for me ; and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head , and i have very little doubt that he has .  <eos>   she played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves , but having no voice , no knowledge of the harp , and no fond parents , to sit by and fancy themselves delighted , her performance was little thought of , only out of civility , or to refresh the others , as she was well aware .  <eos>   an excellent thought of yours , indeed , anne .  <eos>   " and who is admiral croft ?"  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   there was too much domestic happiness in his brother ' s house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; isabella was too much like emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer .-- he had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning ' s post had conveyed the history of jane fairfax .-- then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer .  <eos>   he had not left her long , by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else , when a letter was brought her from randalls -- a very thick letter ;-- she guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity of reading it .-- she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill ; she wanted no explanations , she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself -- and as for understanding any thing he wrote , she was sure she was incapable of it .-- it must be waded through , however .  <eos>   she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .  <eos>   if you want any farther explanation ," continued he , smiling , " they are paid for it .  <eos>   mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the admiral ' s family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant .  <eos>   with the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do i mention miss woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think i ought to add , with the deepest humiliation .-- a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to .-- my behaviour to miss woodhouse indicated , i believe , more than it ought .-- in order to assist a concealment so essential to me , i was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown .-- i cannot deny that miss woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but i am sure you will believe the declaration , that had i not been convinced of her indifference , i would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on .-- amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish .-- she received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured playfulness , which exactly suited me .  <eos>   she was in the carriage , and felt that he had placed her there , that his will and his hands had done it , that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue , and his resolution to give her rest .  <eos>   dear miss woodhouse , he would be thirty years old !"  <eos>   " i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father -- or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately ."  <eos>   he thought principally of mrs . churchill ' s illness , and wanted to know how she was treated ; and as for the ball , it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed ; but they would all be safer at home .  <eos>   " i rather doubt that .  <eos>   if he means any thing , it must be to please you .  <eos>   within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridge - ware box , which harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , emma saw only a small piece of court - plaister .  <eos>   would jane but go , means were to be found , servants sent , friends contrived -- no travelling difficulty allowed to exist ; but still she had declined it !  <eos>   she is a shrewd , intelligent , sensible woman .  <eos>   emma would not have smiled for the world , and only said , " is mr . elton gone on foot to donwell ?-- he will have a hot walk ."  <eos>   i have never been attached to him .  <eos>   anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , charles taking care of his sister , and captain benwick attending to her .  <eos>   " who could have thought it ?  <eos>   replied miss bates .  <eos>   she desired nothing better herself .  <eos>   he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield , as he was to be at home by the middle of the day .  <eos>   cried he , looking eagerly at her , " are you , indeed ?"  <eos>   how the long stage would pass ; how it was to affect their manners ; what was to be their sort of intercourse , she could not foresee .  <eos>   you must go to bed early , my dear -- and i recommend a little gruel to you before you go .-- you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together .  <eos>   his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated ; mrs . churchill was recovering , and he dared not yet , even in his own imagination , fix a time for coming to randalls again .  <eos>   and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies ."  <eos>   " pray , mr . knightley ," said emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , " how do you know that mr . martin did not speak yesterday ?"  <eos>   my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , lords of the earth !  <eos>   where could have been the attraction ?  <eos>   she wanted it to be prescribed , and felt as a duty .  <eos>   you should not have done it , indeed you should not .  <eos>   she was aware herself , that , parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not have rested , as it now almost wholly did , on isabella ' s letters .  <eos>   mr and mrs musgrove took me , and we were so crowded !  <eos>   a fine open sea , he says , and very pure air .  <eos>   she was sorry , but could not repent .  <eos>   either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr . wingfield ' s , which we have been applying at times ever since august ."  <eos>   " i do not wonder , miss woodhouse ," she resumed , " that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body .  <eos>   it makes me envious and miserable ;-- i who have never seen it !  <eos>   said mrs musgrove to mrs croft .  <eos>   a bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may ."  <eos>   has emma read it all ?  <eos>   our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family .  <eos>   he had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ' s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age .  <eos>   i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend .  <eos>   so , there was i , crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louise ; and i think it very likely that my illness to - day may be owing to it ."  <eos>   she hardly knew yet what mr . knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- she even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .  <eos>   " my being charming , harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; i must find other people charming -- one other person at least .  <eos>   mr . and mrs . elton appeared ; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed .  <eos>   there was no occasion to press the matter farther .  <eos>   charles laughed again and said , " now mary , you know very well how it really was .  <eos>   " certainly ," replied he , surprized , " i do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred .  <eos>   i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight .  <eos>   i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely , and fix at lyme .  <eos>   but , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend --"  <eos>   ford ."  <eos>   while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to anne ' s lot to be placed rather apart with captain benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him .  <eos>   on the contrary , i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr . elton as a model .  <eos>   " and i am sure ," cried mary , warmly , " it was a very little to his credit , if he did .  <eos>   " he is very obliging ," said emma ; " but is he sure that harriet means to marry him ?"  <eos>   i lived in perpetual fright at that time , and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself , or when i should hear from him next ; but as long as we could be together , nothing ever ailed me , and i never met with the smallest inconvenience ."  <eos>   " but , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer .  <eos>   " as to who , or what miss hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her ," said emma , " nothing i suppose can be known .  <eos>   i wanted to keep it from jane ' s knowledge ; but , unluckily , i had mentioned it before i was aware ."  <eos>   " yes , you were very cross ; and i do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries .  <eos>   " you forget how much she belongs to highbury .  <eos>   " ah !"  <eos>   " this is very true ," said she , " at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful .-- of the same age -- and always knowing her -- i ought to have been more her friend .-- she will never like me now .  <eos>   there was a bustle on her approach ; a good deal of moving and talking .  <eos>   he could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after mr . frank churchill ' s accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night .  <eos>   as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them no service with sir walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of kellynch hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of sir walter ' s estimate of the dues of a tenant .  <eos>   in one point , i am sure , my dear cousin ," ( he continued , speaking lower , though there was no one else in the room ) " in one point , i am sure , we must feel alike .  <eos>   " no , upon no account in the world , mr . weston ; i am much obliged to you for reminding me .  <eos>   with the help of spectacles .  <eos>   " a man cannot be more so ," was his short , full answer .  <eos>   " but , if i know myself ," said he , " this is from no want of gallantry towards them .  <eos>   they had drawn back from many introductions , and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing .  <eos>   " don ' t talk of it , don ' t talk of it ," he cried .  <eos>   and unfortunately " ( speaking low and tremulously ) " there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late ."  <eos>   emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about mr . frank churchill ' s not coming , except as a disappointment at randalls .  <eos>   i could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as mr . weston came into the room , and i could get at him , i spoke to him about the carriage .  <eos>   mr . dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ?"  <eos>   my dear emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point ."  <eos>   " he ought to come ," said emma .  <eos>   she must see you ."  <eos>   we had great amusement with those letters one morning .  <eos>   we must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment ."  <eos>   such was his own account at randall ' s .  <eos>   if she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and i am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- but , miss smith , indeed !-- oh !  <eos>   and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him , for frank , i mean , that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for -- and still am disposed to give her credit for , in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right .  <eos>   they are not far off .  <eos>   he must be either indifferent or unwilling .  <eos>   you see !"  <eos>   leave little charles to my care .  <eos>   though they had now been acquainted a month , she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character .  <eos>   what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house from what she had brought out !-- she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering ;-- she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away .  <eos>   " never marry !-- this is a new resolution ."  <eos>   could not have supposed any thing !-- such elegance and profusion !-- i have seen nothing like it since -- well , where shall we sit ?  <eos>   it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits , and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it .  <eos>   " certainly -- very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _i_ had been miss campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me .  <eos>   mr . perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could ."  <eos>   emma gave a start , which did not seem like being prepared -- and her eyes , in eager gaze , said , " no , this is impossible !"  <eos>   no , indeed ."  <eos>   her brother ' s return was the first comfort ; he could take best care of his wife ; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary .  <eos>   perry does not call it altogether a sickly season ."  <eos>   we never see any thing of it on our club - nights ."  <eos>   " i am glad you think i have been useful to her ; but harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints .  <eos>   cannot you imagine , mr . knightley , what a _sensation_ his coming will produce ?  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   mr . weston ' s dining - room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , i would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two .  <eos>   she had , however , one very intimate friend , a sensible , deserving woman , who had been brought , by strong attachment to herself , to settle close by her , in the village of kellynch ; and on her kindness and advice , lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters .  <eos>   hardly fit for service then .  <eos>   she could only compare mr elliot to lady russell , in the wish of really comprehending what had passed , and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it .  <eos>   so i got sophy to lend me a hand , and we soon shifted their quarters ; and now i am quite snug , with my little shaving glass in one corner , and another great thing that i never go near ."  <eos>   you and miss smith , and miss fairfax , will be three , and the two miss coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room ."  <eos>   " you are prepared for the worst , i see -- and very bad it is .  <eos>   charles ' s attentions to henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation .  <eos>   " i am sure william larkins will not like it .  <eos>   anne , attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to henrietta , still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet mary , to animate charles , to assuage the feelings of captain wentworth .  <eos>   she was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired .  <eos>   " he wrote a letter to poor mrs . weston , to congratulate her , and a very proper , handsome letter it was .  <eos>   the misfortune of harriet ' s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival .  <eos>   " you like it , my emma , as little as i feared .-- i wish our opinions were the same .  <eos>   yes , i understand the sort of mind .  <eos>   the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by elizabeth martin ' s calling at mrs . goddard ' s a few days afterwards .  <eos>   mrs . weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject .  <eos>   louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister .  <eos>   besides the eltons , it must be the westons and mr . knightley ; so far it was all of course -- and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make the eighth :-- but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction , and on many accounts emma was particularly pleased by harriet ' s begging to be allowed to decline it .  <eos>   she was received with a cordial respect which could not but please , and given all the consequence she could wish for .  <eos>   in fact , it does not concern you -- it concerns only myself ,-- that is , we hope .-- humph !-- in short , my dear emma , there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it .  <eos>   .  <eos>   i meant only myself .  <eos>   mrs . weston proposed having no regular supper ; merely sandwiches , & c ., set out in the little room ; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion .  <eos>   but happily , either anne was improved in plumpness and looks , or lady russell fancied her so ; and anne , in receiving her compliments on the occasion , had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin , and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty .  <eos>   " it is my duty , and i am sure it is my wish ," she continued , " to have no reserves with you on this subject .  <eos>   were she a woman of fortune , i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner .  <eos>   but what shall you do ?  <eos>   before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston ."  <eos>   i am glad he can afford it .  <eos>   emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things , and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment .  <eos>   i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour , i assure you , be he sailor or soldier ."  <eos>   she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .  <eos>   she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings ; a mere pretty , silly , expensive , fashionable woman , i believe ; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery .  <eos>   and after a moment ' s pause , " but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday ."  <eos>   and he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like .  <eos>   her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy .  <eos>   in half a minute they were in the room .  <eos>   " i have some hope ," resumed he , " of my uncle ' s being persuaded to pay a visit at randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her .  <eos>   when you have been here a little longer , miss fairfax , you will understand that mr . elton is the standard of perfection in highbury , both in person and mind ."  <eos>   chapter v  <eos>   and , in short , from knowing his usual ways , i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all .  <eos>   it is remarkable , that emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded .  <eos>   emma and harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in emma ' s opinion , had been talking enough of mr . elton for that day .  <eos>   she shewed it to me .  <eos>   mr . knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day ;-- but they did see him every day as it was .-- why could not they go on as they had done ?  <eos>   and i will own to you , ( i am sure it will be safe ), that so far as our living with mr . churchill at enscombe , it is settled .  <eos>   a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes ."  <eos>   she is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school .  <eos>   i know you are attached to them ."  <eos>   the style of the letter was much above her expectation .  <eos>   there was a seriousness in harriet ' s manner which prepared her , quite as much as her words , for something more than ordinary .  <eos>   anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme , but without being much attended to .  <eos>   she could only resolve to avoid such self - delusion in future , and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell .  <eos>   no misfortune occurred , again to prevent the ball .  <eos>   dear me , how clever !-- could it really be meant for me ?"  <eos>   cole ."  <eos>   since he actually was expected in the country , she must teach herself to be insensible on such points .  <eos>   i think mr . john knightley very far from looking well ."  <eos>   " you forget how much she belongs to highbury .  <eos>   knightley ?"  <eos>   i wonder what will become of her !"  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith ' s .  <eos>   _now_ i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you ."  <eos>   they are very important -- and sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them .  <eos>   now , an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter .  <eos>   i remember saying to myself , ` even emma , with all her partiality for harriet , will think this a good match .'"  <eos>   i wish her extremely well : and , no doubt , there are men who might not object to -- every body has their level : but as for myself , i am not , i think , quite so much at a loss .  <eos>   " you seem to me to have forgotten mrs . and miss bates ," said emma , " i have not heard one inquiry after them ."  <eos>   emma could have wished mrs . elton elsewhere ; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body ; and as mrs . elton met her with unusual graciousness , she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm .  <eos>   the crofts must be in bath !  <eos>   but do come in .  <eos>   " no , indeed -- _we_ are not at all in a bad air .  <eos>   it was now his object to marry .  <eos>   she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and mr . weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on .  <eos>   there was no reason to suppose mr . elton thought at all differently from his wife .  <eos>   a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him ; rather the greatest prize of all , let him have taken ever so many before ; hey , shepherd ?"  <eos>   his perception of the striking improvement of harriet ' s manner , since her introduction at hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment .  <eos>   miss bates was out , which accounted for the previous tranquillity .  <eos>   she could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot ; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church , in the course of the following autumn .  <eos>   i am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do .  <eos>   if one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the coles , for instance .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four - and - twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount .  <eos>   they hurried on , and were speedily at randalls .--" well , my dear ," said he , as they entered the room --" i have brought her , and now i hope you will soon be better .  <eos>   don ' t let us be severe , don ' t let us be in a hurry to condemn him .  <eos>   perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin .-- she did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject .  <eos>   " no ; not immediately here .  <eos>   men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed .  <eos>   his bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice ; and anne elliot was not out of his thoughts , when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with .  <eos>   he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet .  <eos>   thy ready wit the word will soon supply .  <eos>   jemima is so careful ; and she could send us word every hour how he was .  <eos>   harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till mr . elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   " another time , sir , i thank you , not now ."  <eos>   very much grieved and concerned -- i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning ."  <eos>   this was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the great house at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages , mr musgrove ' s coach containing the four ladies , and charles ' s curricle , in which he drove captain wentworth , were descending the long hill into lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone .  <eos>   as mr elliot became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others .  <eos>   " you seem to me to have forgotten mrs . and miss bates ," said emma , " i have not heard one inquiry after them ."  <eos>   he was soon pretty well resigned .  <eos>   she replied with a smile of astonishment , " are you imagining me to be mr . elton ' s object ?"  <eos>   i am very happy .  <eos>   " let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed ," cried emma .  <eos>   what was to be done ?  <eos>   he is a most amiable , charming young man , i believe .  <eos>   perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabella ' s sister , but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of respectful forbearance towards her father .  <eos>   " i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other , which both might not have heard ."  <eos>   my father ' s next heir ?  <eos>   but she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day .-- shocking plan , living together .  <eos>   " a great many things , i assure you .  <eos>   he was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter ."  <eos>   mr . perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill .  <eos>   " elliot of kellynch hall .  <eos>   " to be sure we do ," cried his father ; " mrs . bates -- we passed her house -- i saw miss bates at the window .  <eos>   dear -- i think you play the best of the two .  <eos>   " nothing to the purpose ," replied her brother .  <eos>   weston ?-- to bath , or to clifton ?"  <eos>   " a straightforward , open - hearted man like weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like miss taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns .  <eos>   how very odd !"  <eos>   he seemed about thirty , and though not handsome , had an agreeable person .  <eos>   perhaps to hartfield , perhaps to the abbey mill , perhaps into his woods .-- miss woodhouse , this is not like our friend knightley !-- can you explain it ?"  <eos>   i like old friends ; and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed .  <eos>   elton ?"  <eos>   you got hannah that good place .  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   interrupted emma , " there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over .  <eos>   it is over !"  <eos>   we had better leave the crofts to find their own level .  <eos>   perry .-- i want his directions no more than his drugs ."  <eos>   _she_ could not .  <eos>   of very important , very recordable events , it was not more productive than such meetings usually are .  <eos>   this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come .  <eos>   she had talked her into love ; but , alas !  <eos>   " low , i am afraid , sir , very low ," answered his son ;--" but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way ."  <eos>   emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said ,  <eos>   emma was obliged to ask what they had told her , though fearful of its producing mr . elton .  <eos>   but that would not do .  <eos>   mr shepherd hastened to assure him , that admiral croft was a very hale , hearty , well - looking man , a little weather - beaten , to be sure , but not much , and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour ; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms , only wanted a comfortable home , and to get into it as soon as possible ; knew he must pay for his convenience ; knew what rent a ready - furnished house of that consequence might fetch ; should not have been surprised if sir walter had asked more ; had inquired about the manor ; would be glad of the deputation , certainly , but made no great point of it ; said he sometimes took out a gun , but never killed ; quite the gentleman .  <eos>   but there was no doing any thing , with mr . elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch .  <eos>   " but they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much .  <eos>   your inexperience really amuses me !  <eos>   i hope he will not mind it so very much ."  <eos>   even _your_ satisfaction i made sure of .  <eos>   the hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman -- here , my dear madam , i was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect and compose myself .-- i have been walking over the country , and am now , i hope , rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be .-- it is , in fact , a most mortifying retrospect for me .  <eos>   emma remained in a state of vexation too ; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her ' s , than in his .  <eos>   what arises from discretion must be honoured ."  <eos>   my father ' s next heir ?  <eos>   she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr . elton ' s house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with .  <eos>   i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way ."  <eos>   it was now about the time that she was likely to call .  <eos>   nature gave you understanding :-- miss taylor gave you principles .  <eos>   i thought i should have fainted .  <eos>   she was sure of mrs . weston ' s wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like mr . knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct .  <eos>   once she felt that he was looking at herself , observing her altered features , perhaps , trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him ; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her ; she was hardly aware of it , till she heard the answer ; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced ?  <eos>   " to think of your sending us all your store apples .  <eos>   " so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them !  <eos>   her height was pretty , just such as almost every body would think tall , and nobody could think very tall ; her figure particularly graceful ; her size a most becoming medium , between fat and thin , though a slight appearance of ill - health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two .  <eos>   " you will not like him , i will answer for it ."  <eos>   " these are the sights , harriet , to do one good .  <eos>   " i am ready , if the others are ."  <eos>   said i , ` i shall not forestall jane ; i left her dancing with mr . george otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was mr . elton , i do not know who will ask her next , perhaps mr . william cox .'  <eos>   " do you dare say this ?"  <eos>   after some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank mrs . weston , look sorrowful , and have done .  <eos>   i think you understand me , therefore ."  <eos>   she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character .  <eos>   anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon .  <eos>   good i am sure .-- i see it in your countenance .  <eos>   the hardness of the pavement for her feet , made him less willing upon the present occasion ; he did it , however .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   he saw his son every year in london , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too .  <eos>   " did you ever have your likeness taken , harriet ?"  <eos>   she was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired .  <eos>   yes ; certainly ."  <eos>   indeed , i must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better .  <eos>   leave me , and go to him .  <eos>   yes , i must be there ; i could not refuse ; and i will keep as much awake as i can ; but i would rather be at home , looking over william larkins ' s week ' s account ; much rather , i confess .-- pleasure in seeing dancing !-- not i , indeed -- i never look at it -- i do not know who does .-- fine dancing , i believe , like virtue , must be its own reward .  <eos>   " true .  <eos>   the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire , as he had received it .  <eos>   elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her , and indignantly answered for each party ' s perfectly knowing their situation .  <eos>   he did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him .  <eos>   you want your neighbours ' opinions .  <eos>   united , ( _courtship_ , you know ,) what reverse we have !  <eos>   mr . weston , you must really have had aladdin ' s lamp .  <eos>   i want to puzzle you again ."  <eos>   there was a little hesitation in emma ' s answer .  <eos>   she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr . elton ' s house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with .  <eos>   i hope you find a chair .  <eos>   there was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as mr . elton ' s very promising attachment was likely to add .  <eos>   nursing does not belong to a man ; it is not his province .  <eos>   he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury , as not even miss woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of miss bates ' s good - will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that mrs . elton ' s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by miss woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being " very pleasant and very elegantly dressed ."  <eos>   i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life ."  <eos>   oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day ."  <eos>   but , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well .  <eos>   a very few days brought the party from london , and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet , than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was !-- that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr . knightley , and was now forming all her views of happiness .  <eos>   " i have not said , exert yourself harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of mr . elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , i would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity .  <eos>   " we allowed unnecessary room .  <eos>   i never saw any thing so outree !-- those curls !-- this must be a fancy of her own .  <eos>   we have apple - dumplings , however , very often .  <eos>   " it is odd though ," observed his father , " that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe .  <eos>   always the first person to be thought of !  <eos>   alas !  <eos>   she met mr . weston on his entrance , with a smiling countenance , exclaiming ,  <eos>   yes .  <eos>   man ' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , and woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .  <eos>   she need not trouble herself to pity him .  <eos>   " he is a most fortunate man !"  <eos>   a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance ; but not with a few months ended anne ' s share of suffering from it .  <eos>   they had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before , and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence .  <eos>   the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates .  <eos>   do not you pity me ?"  <eos>   mary deplored the necessity for herself .  <eos>   " the admiralty ," he continued , " entertain themselves now and then , with sending a few hundred men to sea , in a ship not fit to be employed .  <eos>   " who could have thought it ?  <eos>   she had heard , as soon as she got back to mrs . goddard ' s , that mr . martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from mr . martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage .  <eos>   south end is prohibited , if you please .  <eos>   this was mr . elton !  <eos>   " you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am ; but still you must , at least i hope you must , think the better of him for it .  <eos>   you will say that i am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _compliments_ , of course .  <eos>   she recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood .  <eos>   emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted .  <eos>   she could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smith ' s .  <eos>   of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines ."  <eos>   " well , i am very glad indeed : but i always thought you would have it ; i always thought you sure .  <eos>   the carriage was sent for them now .  <eos>   all that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators .  <eos>   he is but young , and his uncle , perhaps --"  <eos>   " well ," said he , in a deliberating manner , " for five minutes , perhaps ."  <eos>   the holidays , however , are over at last : i believe no children ever had such long ones .  <eos>   i told him the distance and the road , and i told him of the church ' s being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , i thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon .  <eos>   there might really have been a liking formerly , though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way ; and now that he could afford to please himself , he might mean to pay his addresses to her .  <eos>   how anne ' s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence .  <eos>   " for shame , emma !  <eos>   i am delighted to find myself in such a circle .  <eos>   no , that must have been quite accidental .  <eos>   harriet looked grave .  <eos>   and i hate italian singing .-- there is no understanding a word of it .  <eos>   ` old fellow !'  <eos>   she was sorry , but could not repent .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , as he would have been sorry to see him before .  <eos>   miss woodhouse , must you be going ?-- you seem but just come -- so very obliging of you ."  <eos>   she had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the campbells , and been given an excellent education .  <eos>   he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air , just as he ought to have , and drew back from conversation .  <eos>   papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ?"  <eos>   and " john , how are you ?"  <eos>   the most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind .  <eos>   but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to .  <eos>   " i either depend more upon emma ' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for i cannot lament the acquaintance .  <eos>   he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more evil than good from them .  <eos>   but a farmer can need none of my help , and is , therefore , in one sense , as much above my notice as in every other he is below it ."  <eos>   i hope she is right .-- in one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , your obliged and affectionate son , f . c . weston churchill .  <eos>   after such behaviour , as i have witnessed during the last month , to miss smith -- such attentions as i have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which i had not supposed possible !  <eos>   she might do very well by herself .  <eos>   " it is frank and miss fairfax ," said mrs . weston .  <eos>   all that were good would be withdrawn ; and if to these losses , the loss of donwell were to be added , what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach ?  <eos>   her attachment and regrets had , for a long time , clouded every enjoyment of youth , and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect .  <eos>   jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice ,  <eos>   " i lay it down as a general rule , harriet , that if a woman _doubts_ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him .  <eos>   emma grew sick at the sound .  <eos>   emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to mrs . bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ' s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods ,  <eos>   the listener ' s proverbial fate was not absolutely hers ; she had heard no evil of herself , but she had heard a great deal of very painful import .  <eos>   and it only harasses me .  <eos>   and now i come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation .  <eos>   he stopped in his earnestness to look the question , and the expression of his eyes overpowered her .  <eos>   his lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   a lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world .  <eos>   it would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- i do not know that -- i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well ."  <eos>   " here have i ," said she , " actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man .  <eos>   whenever she is with us , mrs . cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can .  <eos>   sixteen miles -- nay , eighteen -- it must be full eighteen to manchester - street -- was a serious obstacle .  <eos>   let me hear from you without delay ; i am impatient for a thousand particulars .  <eos>   he began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , " had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman ' s letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference ."  <eos>   " i did ," replied emma , " and they cannot forgive me ."  <eos>   even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes .  <eos>   " come ," said she , " i will tell you something , in return for what you have told me .  <eos>   they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered their expectations in every respect .  <eos>   sir walter , however , would choose his own means , and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation , regret , and entreaty , to his right honourable cousin .  <eos>   .  <eos>   it was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh .  <eos>   " yes ."  <eos>   you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon .  <eos>   that ' s one of the ladies in the irish car party , not at all like her .-- well , i declare --"  <eos>   " that may be done without horses .  <eos>   a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise -- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards .  <eos>   those letters are convenient passports .  <eos>   nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible .  <eos>   this was all sent with the instrument .  <eos>   admiral croft ' s manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell , but they delighted anne .  <eos>   " so unreasonably early !"  <eos>   his bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice ; and anne elliot was not out of his thoughts , when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   as to her illness , all nothing of course .  <eos>   she gave a slight glance round the table , and applied herself to it .  <eos>   there had been the charm .  <eos>   " can you trust me with such flatterers ?-- does my vain spirit ever tell me i am wrong ?"  <eos>   they had a very fine day for box hill ; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement , accommodation , and punctuality , were in favour of a pleasant party .  <eos>   you would have doated on her , had you gone .-- but not a word more .  <eos>   emma was silenced .  <eos>   a little while ago , every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at mr . cole ' s , or balls at the crown .  <eos>   " yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london .  <eos>   he was very much vexed .  <eos>   " ah !"  <eos>   she was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .  <eos>   or in the anxious supplement from mary , of -- " upon my word , i shall be pretty well off , when you are all gone away to be happy at bath !"  <eos>   emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it .  <eos>   " poor girl !"  <eos>   after emma had talked about it for ten minutes , mr . woodhouse felt no unwillingness , and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself , with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him .  <eos>   while she remained , a bush of low rambling holly protected her , and they were moving on .  <eos>   harriet looked white and frightened , and he was trying to cheer her .-- the iron gates and the front - door were not twenty yards asunder ;-- they were all three soon in the hall , and harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away .  <eos>   the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day .  <eos>   " john enters like a brother into my happiness ," continued mr . knightley , " but he is no complimenter ; and though i well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise .  <eos>   well , now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her ."  <eos>   " he chose to say he was employed "--  <eos>   her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given .  <eos>   your friend will not take it amiss i hope .  <eos>   i think your manners to him encouraging .  <eos>   to which his prompt reply was , " most readily , mrs . weston , if you will dance with me ."  <eos>   " ah !"  <eos>   the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma , in a note from mrs . weston , instantly .  <eos>   the good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me .  <eos>   he hesitated , got up , walked to a window .  <eos>   " go to him , go to him ," cried anne , " for heaven ' s sake go to him .  <eos>   " now ," said harriet , " you _must_ recollect ."  <eos>   your sister being with you , my love , i have no scruple at all .  <eos>   all his sanguine expectations , all his confidence had been justified .  <eos>   he paused a moment , again smiling , with his eyes fixed on her face .  <eos>   don ' t scruple .  <eos>   she was not so easily to be talked out of it .  <eos>   it might be a very indifferent piece of wit , but emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it -- and so did frank and harriet .-- it did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally ; some looked very stupid about it , and mr . knightley gravely said ,  <eos>   she considered -- resolved -- and , trying to smile , began --  <eos>   " why , to be sure ," said mr . woodhouse --" yes , certainly -- i cannot deny that mrs . weston , poor mrs . weston , does come and see us pretty often -- but then -- she is always obliged to go away again ."  <eos>   it was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain charles hayter returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think captain wentworth very much in the way .  <eos>   there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her .  <eos>   but this good old mr . woodhouse , i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner .  <eos>   it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady ; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it ;-- and she was considering in what way she had best retract , when mr . weston went on .  <eos>   and now to chuse the mortification of mrs . elton ' s notice and the penury of her conversation , rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real , generous affection ."  <eos>   is not that your idea ?"  <eos>   it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned .  <eos>   on the contrary , i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr . elton as a model .  <eos>   he loves any thing of the sort , and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment .  <eos>   she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that mr . elton should close it .  <eos>   " she is not entirely without it , i think ."  <eos>   mr . knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , mr . woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the bates ' s , said --  <eos>   " aye , we men are sad fellows .  <eos>   she would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out .  <eos>   the first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion .  <eos>   anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger , that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister .  <eos>   " and i am sure , sir ."  <eos>   well , and how did mr . churchill take it ?"  <eos>   but i shall want the ribbon directly -- so it had better go to hartfield -- at least the ribbon .  <eos>   " be satisfied ," said he , " i will not raise any outcry .  <eos>   " yes , you were very cross ; and i do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries .  <eos>   " might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it !  <eos>   now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus -- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned !-- well , this is brilliant !  <eos>   " yes , very true ," cried frank , " very true .  <eos>   the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emma ' s thoughts all the evening .  <eos>   it is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs ."  <eos>   the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties .  <eos>   it was , indeed , so odd ; harriet ' s behaviour was so extremely odd , that emma did not know how to understand it .  <eos>   what is all this ?"  <eos>   with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told .  <eos>   i never saw any thing so hard .  <eos>   as mr elliot became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others .  <eos>   my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried .  <eos>   i am sure miss nash would -- for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen - draper ."  <eos>   she had half a mind to resent ; but an instant ' s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass .  <eos>   " oh yes , sir ," cried she with ready sympathy , " how you must miss her !  <eos>   lady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other : but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present ; for when it was returned , the crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks , to visit their connexions in the north of the county , and probably might not be at home again before lady russell would be removing to bath .  <eos>   ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit -- ( i can never think of it without trembling !)  <eos>   " as you are going farther on business , sir , i will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now .  <eos>   i like her the better for it .  <eos>   " this was settled last night , and frank was off with the light this morning .  <eos>   i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know .  <eos>   she asked after their mutual friends ; they were all well .-- when had he left them ?-- only that morning .  <eos>   the sea is no beautifier , certainly ; sailors do grow old betimes ; i have observed it ; they soon lose the look of youth .  <eos>   the morning of the interesting day arrived , and mrs . weston ' s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten , or eleven , or twelve o ' clock , that she was to think of her at four .  <eos>   and at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person .  <eos>   excepting one short period of her life , she had never , since the age of fourteen , never since the loss of her dear mother , known the happiness of being listened to , or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste .  <eos>   emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance , and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day , with full confidence in their comfort .  <eos>   so i begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , i could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for jane ; and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and jane said the same .  <eos>   anne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell ' s house in september .  <eos>   it was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards captain wentworth .  <eos>   it was foolish , it was wrong , to take so active a part in bringing any two people together .  <eos>   at first , she thought it was a good deal ; and afterwards , but little .  <eos>   actually resolve to break with him entirely !-- she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each -- she dissolved it .-- what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour !-- well , he must be a most extraordinary --"  <eos>   if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled ."  <eos>   in the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing harriet .-- it would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther .-- she was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing harriet ' s confidence .  <eos>   he had given it , he could assure her , very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning , to have his thoughts to himself .  <eos>   he felt it all , so much for her sake .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls , and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in .  <eos>   your sister being with you , my love , i have no scruple at all .  <eos>   no , emma , your amiable young man can be amiable only in french , not in english .  <eos>   if any thing could increase her delight , it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps .  <eos>   harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father ' s footsteps .  <eos>   a man who had been in motion since eight o ' clock in the morning , and might now have been still , who had been long talking , and might have been silent , who had been in more than one crowd , and might have been alone !-- such a man , to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside , and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the world !-- could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife , there would have been a motive ; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party .  <eos>   accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied ,  <eos>   and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one ; her judgement , on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against mr elliot .  <eos>   oh no !  <eos>   emma was just describing the nature of her friend ' s complaint ;-- " a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c . and she was sorry to find from mrs . goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them ."  <eos>   " i did not mean , i was not thinking of the slave - trade ," replied jane ; " governess - trade , i assure you , was all that i had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , i do not know where it lies .  <eos>   i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head .  <eos>   their first pause was at the crown inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one of the sort , where a couple of pair of post - horses were kept , more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added ; it had been built many years ago for a ball - room , and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous , dancing state , had been occasionally used as such ;-- but such brilliant days had long passed away , and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half - gentlemen of the place .  <eos>   i wanted them to put off the wedding ."  <eos>   " but i thought you would .  <eos>   the great mrs . churchill was no more .  <eos>   mr . elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he exclaimed ,  <eos>   your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you .  <eos>   " the clerks grow expert from habit .-- they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them .  <eos>   i assured him that i could not .  <eos>   " was he agreeable ?"  <eos>   " why , really , dear emma , i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _not_ being in love with her , that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last .  <eos>   ."  <eos>   what anne first heard was --  <eos>   his good sense and good principles would delight you .-- as far as the man is concerned , you could not wish your friend in better hands .  <eos>   " your command ?-- yes ."  <eos>   " one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , harriet .  <eos>   " yes , papa ; we have something to read you , something quite fresh .  <eos>   emma spoke for her .  <eos>   she had no difficulty in procuring isabella ' s invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention .-- there was a tooth amiss .  <eos>   you wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last : and besides what i felt on her account , i have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner ."  <eos>   jane , don ' t you remember grandmama ' s telling us of it when we got home ?  <eos>   he had said that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs . elton which nobody else paid her .  <eos>   they had been once more in the same room .  <eos>   as for mr . elton , his manners did not appear -- but no , she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners .  <eos>   miss bates was out , which accounted for the previous tranquillity .  <eos>   every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married ."  <eos>   if he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while i was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you .  <eos>   " well , and that is as early as most men can afford to marry , who are not born to an independence .  <eos>   i should not have used the expression .  <eos>   to look on , while repeated attentions were offering to another woman , before her face , and not resent it .-- that is a degree of placidity , which i can neither comprehend nor respect ."  <eos>   but then , mrs . goddard will want to see it .-- and i could take the pattern gown home any day .  <eos>   came there about the year --- , i take it .  <eos>   just as they were setting off , the gentlemen returned .  <eos>   miss fairfax , i dare say , would not have me if i were to ask her -- and i am very sure i shall never ask her ."  <eos>   -- with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness .  <eos>   i met _one_ as i came -- madness in such weather !-- absolute madness !"  <eos>   ah !  <eos>   she would not marry , even if she were asked by mr . knightley .  <eos>   emma ' s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed ,-- aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion : but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible .  <eos>   she would not let jane say , ` no ;' for when jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at donwell ,) when jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbell ' s return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told mrs . elton over and over again -- and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind !-- but that good mrs . elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than i did .  <eos>   an admiral speaks his own consequence , and , at the same time , can never make a baronet look small .  <eos>   serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them .  <eos>   after a few minutes of entire silence between them , john knightley began with --  <eos>   so you would all .  <eos>   " they walked , i conclude .  <eos>   a short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period , and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners , and of seeing captain wentworth .  <eos>   anne could only feel that charles hayter was wise .  <eos>   i would rather not be tempted .  <eos>   cried sir basil , ` it is admiral baldwin .  <eos>   i could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as mr . weston came into the room , and i could get at him , i spoke to him about the carriage .  <eos>   but really , i could almost venture , if harriet would sit to me .  <eos>   it is my party .  <eos>   she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr . elton .  <eos>   -- then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , " well , now tell me every thing ; make this intelligible to me .  <eos>   you , who have not a mother ' s feelings , are a great deal the properest person .  <eos>   i always take the part of my own sex .  <eos>   the post - office has a great charm at one period of our lives .  <eos>   " how often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us !-- we shall be always meeting !  <eos>   now , an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   to amuse her , and be agreeable in her eyes , seemed all that he cared for -- and emma , glad to be enlivened , not sorry to be flattered , was gay and easy too , and gave him all the friendly encouragement , the admission to be gallant , which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance ; but which now , in her own estimation , meant nothing , though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very well describe .  <eos>   cried mr .  <eos>   she was received with a cordial respect which could not but please , and given all the consequence she could wish for .  <eos>   but it is even so .  <eos>   but then patty came in , and said it was you .  <eos>   now , my dear madam , i will release you ; but i could not conclude before .  <eos>   he did so , but very soon stopt again to say , " the pianoforte !  <eos>   " so do i , anne ," said charles .  <eos>   " now , ma ' am ," said jane to her aunt , " shall we join mrs .  <eos>   " such an extraordinary dream of mine !"  <eos>   there is nobody in highbury who deserves him -- and he has been here a whole year , and has fitted up his house so comfortably , that it would be a shame to have him single any longer -- and i thought when he was joining their hands to - day , he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him !  <eos>   volume iii  <eos>   " i met william larkins ," continued mr . elton , " as i got near the house , and he told me i should not find his master at home , but i did not believe him .-- william seemed rather out of humour .  <eos>   she was certainly not a woman of family , but well educated , accomplished , rich , and excessively in love with his friend .  <eos>   the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room .  <eos>   " you are going in , i suppose ?"  <eos>   consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know .  <eos>   it used to stand here .  <eos>   her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness .  <eos>   captain harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before , and captain wentworth ' s anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to lyme .  <eos>   she is a standing lesson of how to be happy .  <eos>   anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell .  <eos>   he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips .  <eos>   there being nothing to eat , he could only have some play ; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother , he began to fasten himself upon her , as she knelt , in such a way that , busy as she was about charles , she could not shake him off .  <eos>   ten couple may stand here very well ."  <eos>   but why so ?-- i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too ."  <eos>   i know what it is , for mr musgrove always attends the assizes , and i am so glad when they are over , and he is safe back again ."  <eos>   " it comes to the same thing .  <eos>   " only think !  <eos>   my dear sir , her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it .  <eos>   the walking party had crossed the lane , and were surmounting an opposite stile , and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again , when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister .  <eos>   in respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are .  <eos>   it will be taking out my freedom .-- i dare say they sell gloves ."  <eos>   their actual speed , heightened by some dread of the conclusion , made the road appear but half as long as on the day before .  <eos>   who cried most ?"  <eos>   " there are few among the gentlemen of the navy , i imagine , who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description ."  <eos>   some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs . weston ' s drawing - room ;-- mr . elton must compose his joyous looks , and mr . john knightley disperse his ill - humour .  <eos>   what a pity it is that mr . weston ever thought of her !"  <eos>   i never shall forget his manner .  <eos>   mrs . stokes ,' said i -- but i had not time for more ."  <eos>   such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her !-- such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy !  <eos>   the good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me .  <eos>   the strength of the song falls on the second ."  <eos>   now i cannot say , that i think you are any of you looking well at present ."  <eos>   the minutiae of the business anne could not attempt to understand ; even captain wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman ' s side , and a relenting on the lady ' s , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt .  <eos>   call upon her , by all means ."  <eos>   at another time emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at mr . elton ' s spirits for other feelings .  <eos>   she was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious !  <eos>   if he were deficient there , nothing should make amends for it .  <eos>   there will be enough of them , in all probability , to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need .  <eos>   a fine complimentary opening : but it is his way .  <eos>   -- what does this mean ?  <eos>   harriet unfolded the parcel , and she looked on with impatience .  <eos>   we always say what we like to one another ."  <eos>   " and she ," said mrs smith , " besides nursing me most admirably , has really proved an invaluable acquaintance .  <eos>   harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to .  <eos>   he had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife ' s occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to anne ' s admiration , and upon the whole , though there was very often a little disagreement ( in which she had sometimes more share than she wished , being appealed to by both parties ), they might pass for a happy couple .  <eos>   mr . weston seems an excellent creature -- quite a first - rate favourite with me already , i assure you .  <eos>   i am sure mr . elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage ."  <eos>   i condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me .'"  <eos>   lady russell began talking of something else .  <eos>   i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life ."  <eos>   " yes -- what should hurt me ?-- i walk fast .  <eos>   it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion , to foresee the smiles , the sneers , the merriment it would prompt at his expense ; the mortification and disdain of his brother , the thousand inconveniences to himself .-- could it be ?-- no ; it was impossible .  <eos>   he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her ; a nervous seizure , which had lasted some hours -- and he had quite given up every thought of coming , till very late ;-- and had he known how hot a ride he should have , and how late , with all his hurry , he must be , he believed he should not have come at all .  <eos>   " i honour his sincerity .  <eos>   mrs . churchill rules at enscombe , and is a very odd - tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends upon her being willing to spare him ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   when shall i leave you again ?"  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   i shall have no fears for you with him .  <eos>   " the sooner every party breaks up , the better ."  <eos>   " oh , mrs . churchill ; every body knows mrs . churchill ," replied isabella : " and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion .  <eos>   " oh , dear ," cried harriet , " now i recollect what you mean ; but i was thinking of something very different at the time .  <eos>   it is natural , and it is honourable .-- yes , honourable , i think , to chuse so well and so gratefully .-- but that it will be a fortunate preference is more that i can promise .  <eos>   miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristol -- merchant , of course , he must be called ; but , as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also .  <eos>   " miss woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , i must do as well as i can by myself ; and i have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse mr . martin .  <eos>   " and i will tell you our reason ," she added , " and all about it .  <eos>   the first error and the worst lay at her door .  <eos>   " we must be decided , and without the loss of another minute .  <eos>   but i could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well .  <eos>   " i thank you ; but i assure you you are quite mistaken .  <eos>   he thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it .  <eos>   my right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question .  <eos>   she had this communication , moreover , from mary .  <eos>   she is always so attentive to them !"  <eos>   there was no superiority of manner , accomplishment , or understanding .  <eos>   emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him .  <eos>   he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , mr . knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus --  <eos>   elton was sitting here , i remember , much about where i am now ."  <eos>   " you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates ," said emma .  <eos>   mrs . cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates , and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte -- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand , but a large - sized square pianoforte ; and the substance of the story , the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations on her side , and explanations on miss bates ' s , was , that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwood ' s the day before , to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at first , by miss bates ' s account , jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it -- but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter ;-- of course it must be from colonel campbell .  <eos>   she promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it , with the intention of finding it a very good scheme .  <eos>   he had not been at donwell for two years .  <eos>   a situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ' s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly ."  <eos>   at the end of that period , lady russell ' s politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self - threatenings of the past became in a decided tone , " i must call on mrs croft ; i really must call upon her soon .  <eos>   it was owing to _her_ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm .  <eos>   and there was a mrs wallis , at present known only to them by description , as she was in daily expectation of her confinement ; but mr elliot spoke of her as " a most charming woman , quite worthy of being known in camden place ," and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted .  <eos>   either of them would , in all probability , make him an affectionate , good - humoured wife .  <eos>   if she can hesitate as to ` yes ,' she ought to say ` no ' directly .  <eos>   it was owing to _her_ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm .  <eos>   " he trifles here ," said he , " as to the temptation .  <eos>   there must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for ."  <eos>   evil to some is always good to others .  <eos>   this is a point which you must settle with your feelings ."  <eos>   this was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference -- ( for still her resolution held of never marrying )-- the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance .  <eos>   there was so much of friendliness , and of flattery , and of everything most bewitching in his reception there ; the old were so hospitable , the young so agreeable , that he could not but resolve to remain where he was , and take all the charms and perfections of edward ' s wife upon credit a little longer .  <eos>   he felt it all , so much for her sake .  <eos>   her influence would have been enough .  <eos>   -- was a question , however , which did not augur much .  <eos>   it would have surprised anne if louisa could have readily answered such a speech : words of such interest , spoken with such serious warmth !  <eos>   mr . frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .  <eos>   my dear , it is not like hartfield .  <eos>   " i hope he does ," replied mr . knightley coolly , and resuming the letter .  <eos>   " certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life ."  <eos>   i hope we shall have her here next week .  <eos>   and unfortunately " ( speaking low and tremulously ) " there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late ."  <eos>   they sat down to tea -- the same party round the same table -- how often it had been collected !-- and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun !-- but never in such a state of spirits , never in any thing like it ; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house , or even the attentive daughter .  <eos>   she heard enough to know that mr . weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words " my son ," and " frank ," and " my son ," repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet mr . elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward .  <eos>   you know how much he wanted money : worse than myself .  <eos>   dear me !  <eos>   and in short , she said more than her husband could long withstand , and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way , there was no help for it ; the change of mary for anne was inevitable .  <eos>   emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment .  <eos>   william larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year .  <eos>   mary talked , but she could not attend .  <eos>   a note was written to urge it .  <eos>   " a house of her own !-- but where is the advantage of a house of her own ?  <eos>   " i have not even made any inquiry ; i do not wish to make any yet ."  <eos>   no !--( in an accent meant to be insinuating )-- i am sure you have seen and understood me ."  <eos>   " well , my dear jane , i believe we must be running away .  <eos>   she was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy .  <eos>   but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do .  <eos>   " to be sure !"  <eos>   she had no sense of superiority then .  <eos>   the ladies had not been long in the drawing - room , before the other ladies , in their different divisions , arrived .  <eos>   his father would not own himself uneasy , and laughed at her fears ; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare .  <eos>   but mr . elton , in person , had driven away all such cares .  <eos>   in the course of the same morning , anne and her father chancing to be alone together , he began to compliment her on her improved looks ; he thought her " less thin in her person , in her cheeks ; her skin , her complexion , greatly improved ; clearer , fresher .  <eos>   -- harriet ' s was --  <eos>   an arch look expressed --" i understand you well enough ;" but she said only , " miss fairfax is reserved ."  <eos>   she was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy .  <eos>   once , i felt the fire rather too much ; but then i moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me .  <eos>   an admiral speaks his own consequence , and , at the same time , can never make a baronet look small .  <eos>   emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in mrs . goddard ' s unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much mr . elton ' s would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much .  <eos>   if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it ;-- and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can ;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man ' s house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow .  <eos>   that ' s right .  <eos>   it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible , for they met every morning , and hardly ever spent an evening asunder ; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of mr and mrs musgrove ' s respectable forms in the usual places , or without the talking , laughing , and singing of their daughters .  <eos>   in my bath life , i have seen such instances of it !  <eos>   so very good of them to send her the whole way !  <eos>   it had then seemed the object nearest her heart , that dr shirley , the rector , who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office , but was now growing too infirm for many of them , should be quite fixed on engaging a curate ; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford , and should give charles hayter the promise of it .  <eos>   frank churchill ' s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much , that his last words to emma were ,  <eos>   but , i assure you , i have never been in the house above twice in my life ."  <eos>   mr . woodhouse was resigned .  <eos>   if you need farther explanation , i have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband ' s son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of .-- see me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to randalls ;-- and here i am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid .  <eos>   " she really left nothing for mary to do .  <eos>   this friend , and sir walter , did not marry , whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance .  <eos>   do you think it is a good one ?  <eos>   " ah !"  <eos>   short of that , it is all guess and luck -- and will generally be ill - luck .  <eos>   " how do you do , mrs . ford ?  <eos>   mrs harville , a degree less polished than her husband , seemed , however , to have the same good feelings ; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own , because the friends of captain wentworth , or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them .  <eos>   you will have my sketches , some time or other , to look at -- or my tour to read -- or my poem .  <eos>   there was no immediate appearance .  <eos>   but this was not judged feasible .  <eos>   he might observe that it was so .  <eos>   it seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity .  <eos>   " you know what you are about ."  <eos>   their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane , a lane leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular , main street of the place ; and , as may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of mr . elton .  <eos>   " and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain .  <eos>   for herself , she feared to move , lest she should be seen .  <eos>   she could only offer one solution ; it was , perhaps , for elizabeth ' s sake .  <eos>   the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ), had brought anne the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more .  <eos>   john knightley came ; but mr . weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   a larger society would improve them .  <eos>   the event was more favourable to mr . woodhouse than to emma .  <eos>   " it is as long again as almost all we have had before ."  <eos>   my right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question .  <eos>   i will say that for you ."  <eos>   she understood him .  <eos>   it was a perpetual estrangement .  <eos>   " that fellow ," said he , indignantly , " thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice .  <eos>   to mr . john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility .  <eos>   by all their calculations there was just time for this ; but as they drew near the cobb , there was such a general wish to walk along it once more , all were so inclined , and louisa soon grew so determined , that the difference of a quarter of an hour , it was found , would be no difference at all ; so with all the kind leave - taking , and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined , they parted from captain and mrs harville at their own door , and still accompanied by captain benwick , who seemed to cling to them to the last , proceeded to make the proper adieus to the cobb .  <eos>   the muffin last night -- if it had been handed round once , i think it would have been enough ."  <eos>   " i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child .  <eos>   in one respect he is the object of my envy ."  <eos>   i went .  <eos>   " did he appear a sensible young man ; a young man of information ?"  <eos>   mrs . elton was spoken of .  <eos>   i do not want to say more than is necessary -- i am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done , and i dare say you understand me ."  <eos>   replied emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether harriet could indeed have received any hint .  <eos>   chapter viii  <eos>   on the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question .  <eos>   " i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk ," said mary , as she went up stairs .  <eos>   one accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize -- a second , slightly but correctly taken by frank churchill .  <eos>   they were never tolerated at maple grove .  <eos>   such a sad loss to our party to - day !"  <eos>   at last emma attacked her on another ground .  <eos>   the symptoms were favourable .-- instead of answering , harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard .  <eos>   i should like it of all things ," was not plainer in words than manner .  <eos>   every body seemed happy ; and the praise of being a delightful ball , which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be , was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this .  <eos>   i am sure he has not the least idea of it .  <eos>   .  <eos>   it is such a blessing !  <eos>   there were mr . and mrs . weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect .  <eos>   and at lyme too , only seventeen miles off , he would be near enough to hear , if people thought there was anything to complain of ."  <eos>   mr . elton then turned back to accompany them .  <eos>   i think , emma , i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us .  <eos>   your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her .-- she will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman ' s language can make interesting .-- in our communications we deal only in the great .-- however , i must say , that robert martin ' s heart seemed for _him_ , and to _me_ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at astley ' s , my brother took charge of mrs . john knightley and little john , and he followed with miss smith and henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make miss smith rather uneasy ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   i hope he will be calling soon .  <eos>   if there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment .  <eos>   he was coming through the hall .  <eos>   how was she to bear the change ?-- it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs . weston , only half a mile from them , and a miss taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .  <eos>   he seemed about thirty , and though not handsome , had an agreeable person .  <eos>   you can make little charles do anything ; he always minds you at a word .  <eos>   i was there -- one of the party ."  <eos>   emma could say no more .  <eos>   i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you .  <eos>   " my dearest emma ," said he , " for dearest you will always be , whatever the event of this hour ' s conversation , my dearest , most beloved emma -- tell me at once .  <eos>   her mind was quite sick of mr . elton and the martins .  <eos>   but soon it came to be on one side ,  <eos>   jane came back delighted yesterday .  <eos>   for thirteen years had she been doing the honours , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing - rooms and dining - rooms in the country .  <eos>   people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style ."  <eos>   when the gloves were bought , and they had quitted the shop again , " did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ?"  <eos>   emma would not agree to this , and began a warm defence of miss fairfax ' s complexion .  <eos>   she went on , however .  <eos>   emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh .  <eos>   " no , indeed , i have no doubts at all on that head .  <eos>   however , i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again .  <eos>   she , however , was soon persuaded to think differently .  <eos>   chapter vi  <eos>   every report agreed in captain wentworth ' s appearing fixed in lyme .  <eos>   she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and mr . weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on .  <eos>   " yes ," he replied , and without the smallest apparent embarrassment .-- " but they would have done better had they given her notice of it .  <eos>   matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter ' s marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield .  <eos>   " as to all that ," rejoined sir walter coolly , " supposing i were induced to let my house , i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it .  <eos>   " dear me !  <eos>   one could not leave her out ."  <eos>   be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible ."  <eos>   was uttered by captain wentworth , anne was sure could never be forgotten by her ; nor the sight of him afterwards , as he sat near a table , leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed , as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul , and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them .  <eos>   to you -- to my two daughters -- i may venture on the truth .  <eos>   but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once , and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time .  <eos>   mr shepherd had once mentioned the word " advertise ," but never dared approach it again .  <eos>   " the sooner every party breaks up , the better ."  <eos>   it was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see mr . knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit .  <eos>   and one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves , one of them after talking of rank , people of rank , and jealousy of rank , said , " i have no scruple of observing to you , how nonsensical some persons are about their place , because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it ; but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious , especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma .  <eos>   it must be very clever , or he would not have brought it .  <eos>   cried jane , with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure --" there would have been no danger .  <eos>   she is reserved , more reserved , i think , than she used to be -- and i love an open temper .  <eos>   i believe he is one of the very best - tempered men that ever existed .  <eos>   mr . frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .  <eos>   " you appear to feel a great deal -- but i am not aware how you or any of miss fairfax ' s acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than "--  <eos>   " but why should you be sorry , sir ?-- i assure you , it did the children a great deal of good ."  <eos>   " i am sure william larkins will not like it .  <eos>   to look on , while repeated attentions were offering to another woman , before her face , and not resent it .-- that is a degree of placidity , which i can neither comprehend nor respect ."  <eos>   fortunately for him , highbury , including randalls in the same parish , and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of mr . knightley , comprehended many such .  <eos>   captain benwick and louisa musgrove !  <eos>   her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _was_ good enough .  <eos>   you should not have done it , indeed you should not .  <eos>   soft is the very word for her eye -- of all epithets , the justest that could be given .  <eos>   the contrast between mrs . churchill ' s importance in the world , and jane fairfax ' s , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman ' s destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by miss bates ' s saying ,  <eos>   it was her own choice to give the time of their absence to highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else .  <eos>   some one must resolve on being off for uppercross instantly .  <eos>   " it is hotter to - day ."  <eos>   she was sitting by mr . knightley , and turned to him for help .  <eos>   " i am no match - maker , as you well know ," said lady russell , " being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations .  <eos>   she bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause .  <eos>   the decree is issued by somebody .  <eos>   my courage rises while i write .  <eos>   this discovery laid many smaller matters open .  <eos>   the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming --  <eos>   " indeed !"  <eos>   emma wondered on what , of all the medley , she would fix .  <eos>   he had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it .  <eos>   he had not seen louisa ; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview , that he did not press for it at all ; and , on the contrary , seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days , till her head was stronger .  <eos>   no : the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing , manly , open look , in no respect lessening his personal advantages .  <eos>   this would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute .  <eos>   anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again .  <eos>   " you will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible .  <eos>   it is too unlikely , for me to believe it without proof ."  <eos>   " yes ," he replied , " any body may know how highly i think of her ."  <eos>   they all met , and were introduced .  <eos>   emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault .  <eos>   you may believe me , mrs . weston .  <eos>   she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish .  <eos>   he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father ' s having any right to complain .  <eos>   it was all quite natural , however .  <eos>   her mind returned to mrs . elton ' s offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her .  <eos>   he had not forgiven anne elliot .  <eos>   " certainly , if you wish it ;-- but you are not going to walk to highbury alone ?"  <eos>   when we talked about him , it was as clear as possible ."  <eos>   when she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there .  <eos>   i knew how it would be .  <eos>   said he with a tender sigh , as he received it .  <eos>   emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly .  <eos>   so long ago as the 7th of november , ( as i am going to read to you ,) and has never been well since .  <eos>   -- yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with mrs . weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners .  <eos>   miniatures , half - lengths , whole - lengths , pencil , crayon , and water - colours had been all tried in turn .  <eos>   she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed .-- there was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible .  <eos>   " how is your niece , miss bates ?-- i want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece .  <eos>   but by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger ; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut , nor ran foul of a dung - cart ; and anne , with some amusement at their style of driving , which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs , found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage .  <eos>   the regular and best families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite -- neither donwell , nor hartfield , nor randalls .  <eos>   that very dear part of emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply .  <eos>   " not i , indeed .  <eos>   alas !  <eos>   but mrs musgrove , who got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially , again and again , for all her attentions to them , concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing , with a happy glance round the room , that after all she had gone through , nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home .  <eos>   " oh , no !  <eos>   when the crofts called this morning , ( they called here afterwards , did not they ?  <eos>   " but what are you in doubt of ?  <eos>   said she ; " that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you ."  <eos>   such scarecrows as the streets were full of !  <eos>   that , i thought , in a man of known musical talent , was some proof ."  <eos>   i saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other ."  <eos>   " it is so , indeed ," continued mr . knightley ; " i have it from robert martin himself .  <eos>   they were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which lyme , as a public place , might offer .  <eos>   poor mr . woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer .  <eos>   they were wretched comforters for one another ."  <eos>   " another thing must be taken into consideration too -- mrs . elton does not talk _to_ miss fairfax as she speaks _of_ her .  <eos>   " let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed ," cried emma .  <eos>   a few minutes more , and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over .  <eos>   the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do .  <eos>   mrs clay , who had been present while all this passed , now thought it advisable to leave the room , and anne could have said much , and did long to say a little in defence of her friend ' s not very dissimilar claims to theirs , but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her .  <eos>   " miss elliot ," said he , speaking rather low , " you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much .  <eos>   were i to fall in love , indeed , it would be a different thing !  <eos>   while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse , i could deserve nothing from either .  <eos>   he had done , and was unanswered .  <eos>   i am not at all afraid .  <eos>   poor miss taylor !  <eos>   jane ' s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her .  <eos>   i like them all ."  <eos>   " this present from the campbells ," said she --" this pianoforte is very kindly given ."  <eos>   her sensibilities , i suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness .  <eos>   " something a little inferior i shall of course put up with , but it must not be much .  <eos>   a fine open sea , he says , and very pure air .  <eos>   but they always do , you know .  <eos>   why was it so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr . knightley , than with frank churchill ?  <eos>   " yes ," replied harriet modestly , but not fearfully --" i must say that i have ."  <eos>   " did you ever have your likeness taken , harriet ?"  <eos>   i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper ."  <eos>   " of course ," said mary , " you will mention our seeing mr elliot , the next time you write to bath .  <eos>   said sir walter , in the height of his good humour .  <eos>   she would not look again .  <eos>   this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection .  <eos>   " i do not know ; but i can hardly suppose that , at admiral croft ' s time of life , and in his profession , he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this ."  <eos>   and how beautiful we thought he looked !  <eos>   my heart was in highbury , and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be , and with the least suspicion .  <eos>   emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a " very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter ."  <eos>   i do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries ."  <eos>   you quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , i assure you mr . suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition ."  <eos>   they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister .  <eos>   it has hurt his father equally .  <eos>   harriet was soon back again , and the proposal almost immediately made ; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others .  <eos>   " i shall never let that book go out of my own hands ," said she .  <eos>   so very obliging of mr . frank churchill !  <eos>   she was so surprized she did not know what to do .  <eos>   an unpretending , single - minded , artless girl -- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs . elton .  <eos>   i think their father is too rough with them very often ."  <eos>   ah !  <eos>   " my poor dear isabella ," said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children --" how long it is , how terribly long since you were here !  <eos>   " me !"  <eos>   she had used him ill , deserted and disappointed him ; and worse , she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so , which his own decided , confident temper could not endure .  <eos>   captain harville had taken his present house for half a year ; his taste , and his health , and his fortune , all directing him to a residence inexpensive , and by the sea ; and the grandeur of the country , and the retirement of lyme in the winter , appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick ' s state of mind .  <eos>   you said you had a great many , and now you have not one left .  <eos>   dixon in them ."  <eos>   when she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there .  <eos>   in a moment he went on --  <eos>   the intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by emma and mr .  <eos>   my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried .  <eos>   " my dear , you do not understand me .  <eos>   " impossible !-- i never can call you any thing but ` mr .  <eos>   give him a book , and he will read all day long ."  <eos>   this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him .  <eos>   " i will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body ' s assistance ."  <eos>   she is playing _robin_ _adair_ at this moment -- _his_ favourite ."  <eos>   anne was still in the lane ; and though instinctively beginning to decline , she was not allowed to proceed .  <eos>   that , from such a quarter , one might expect .  <eos>   no doubt it had been from jealousy .-- in jane ' s eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed .  <eos>   " those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference .  <eos>   knightley ."  <eos>   her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emma ' s eyes -- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do .  <eos>   lady russell could not hear the door - bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father ' s grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him .  <eos>   i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie , trying to understand , and make him understand , which of elizabeth ' s plants are for lady russell .  <eos>   he had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after lady elliot ' s death , sir walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing - back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to london , when elizabeth was in her first bloom , mr elliot had been forced into the introduction .  <eos>   you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me !  <eos>   he had seen the coachmen , and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend .  <eos>   a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings !  <eos>   neither father nor mother could promote , and the daughter could not endure it .  <eos>   frank churchill ' s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing .  <eos>   " true , true ," he answered , warmly .  <eos>   every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month .  <eos>   he has been gone only four weeks ."  <eos>   mrs . weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied .  <eos>   a letter arrived from mr . churchill to urge his nephew ' s instant return .  <eos>   she had been thinking of him the moment before , as unquestionably sixteen miles distant .-- there was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind .  <eos>   no -- i would get you a better partner than myself .  <eos>   gone to mr . woodhouse ' s .  <eos>   not that i think mr . martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up .  <eos>   you and i shall not want opportunities .  <eos>   i have not seen a creature the whole morning !"  <eos>   weston .-- so it proved ;-- for when happily released from mr . elton , and seated by mr . weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her ,  <eos>   he considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy ; and the sir walter elliot , who united these gifts , was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion .  <eos>   and what is her attraction ?  <eos>   " she will not be surprized , papa , at least ."  <eos>   this letter must make its way to emma ' s feelings .  <eos>   " six years hence !  <eos>   cried emma , " this has been a most unfortunate -- most deplorable mistake !-- what is to be done ?"  <eos>   that is a great thing .  <eos>   events of every description , changes , alienations , removals -- all , all must be comprised in it , and oblivion of the past -- how natural , how certain too !  <eos>   he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal , and came back all the better -- grown quite cool -- and , with good manners , like himself -- able to draw a chair close to them , take an interest in their employment ; and regret , in a reasonable way , that he should be so late .  <eos>   " what a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces .  <eos>   there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject .  <eos>   you will stay , and go with us ?"  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   i cannot pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine -- i overheard him telling henrietta all about it ; and then ` miss elliot ' was spoken of in the highest terms !  <eos>   had she never brought harriet forward !  <eos>   they could go there again with them in the autumn .  <eos>   it would excite no proper interest there .  <eos>   my mother ' s spectacles .  <eos>   perry !-- such attention to jane !"  <eos>   we are not asked to dine with them , however , till the day after , mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey , which is not very likely , considering the care that will be taken of her ; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to - morrow .  <eos>   she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis , an event , a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state .  <eos>   " a very fine young man indeed , mr . weston .  <eos>   " i am sorry to find you unwell ," replied anne .  <eos>   they remained but a few minutes together , as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose .  <eos>   mrs charles musgrove will , of course , wish to get back to her children ; but if anne will stay , no one so proper , so capable as anne ."  <eos>   " for my companion tells me ," said she , " that i absolutely promised miss bates last night , that i would come this morning .  <eos>   " a sore - throat !-- i hope not infectious .  <eos>   his civilities to the other ladies must be paid ; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering , and the walk he had had for nothing .  <eos>   why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room ?-- she who could do any thing in highbury !  <eos>   i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can , i must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before ."  <eos>   it is the garden of england , you know .  <eos>   leave all that to me .  <eos>   a larger society would improve them .  <eos>   sir walter had once been in company with the late viscount , but had never seen any of the rest of the family ; and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony , ever since the death of that said late viscount , when , in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter ' s at the same time , there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch .  <eos>   that was a point which anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as mary , from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself .  <eos>   harriet bore the intelligence very well -- blaming nobody -- and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend .  <eos>   i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad .  <eos>   " yes , my dear , if there is time .-- but --( in a very depressed tone )-- she is coming for only one week .  <eos>   emma , in the meanwhile , could not be satisfied without a dinner at hartfield for the eltons .  <eos>   i am quite of your opinion .  <eos>   gilbert would have danced the other evening , if she had been asked .  <eos>   i feel that all the apologies should be on my side .  <eos>   it was , indeed , so odd ; harriet ' s behaviour was so extremely odd , that emma did not know how to understand it .  <eos>   " poor dear fellow !"  <eos>   mrs . weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa .  <eos>   ` can i do any thing for you at kingston ?'  <eos>   she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .  <eos>   " has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not ?"  <eos>   walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good ;" and , in short , her look and manner declared , that go she would not .  <eos>   the young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on harriet ' s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own .  <eos>   when this was told , his name distressed her no longer .  <eos>   though neither henrietta , nor louisa , nor charles hayter , nor captain wentworth were there , the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in .  <eos>   the girls were wild for dancing ; and the evenings ended , occasionally , in an unpremeditated little ball .  <eos>   she goes into the warm bath to - morrow , and for the rest of the week , you know , we are engaged ."  <eos>   " depend upon it , mrs . churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did .  <eos>   he had been there for four - and - twenty hours .  <eos>   was mr . woodhouse ' s first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time .  <eos>   emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend .  <eos>   without emulating the feelings of an emma towards her henry , she would have attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard , for his sake ; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend .  <eos>   -- seemed to burst from an overcharged heart , and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her , even towards some of those who loved her best .  <eos>   be it known then , that sir walter , like a good father , ( having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications ), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters ' sake .  <eos>   " depend upon it , they were all perfectly comfortable ."  <eos>   there he is .  <eos>   you wrote me word of it three months ago ."  <eos>   " i think they will neither of them do the other any good ."  <eos>   a sick child is always the mother ' s property : her own feelings generally make it so ."  <eos>   said he ; so i just mentioned .  <eos>   " the last time i saw her she had a red nose , but i hope that may not happen every day ."  <eos>   mrs . churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for "--  <eos>   she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with , and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever , which , finally settling in her legs , had made her for the present a cripple .  <eos>   " nothing very bad .-- the fate of thousands .  <eos>   my only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him .  <eos>   oh !-- you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for mr . weston has told me himself .  <eos>   charles laughed .  <eos>   it would be a great comfort to mr . weston , as he grew older -- and even mr . weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense , the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home ; and mrs . weston -- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her ; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach , should not have their powers in exercise again .  <eos>   you have scolded me too much for match - making , for me to presume to take such a liberty with you .  <eos>   charming people , mr . and mrs . weston ;-- mrs . weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society ;-- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any .  <eos>   it was a done thing ; mr . elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her .  <eos>   but fetch them both .  <eos>   she was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved .  <eos>   there is no hurry at all .  <eos>   yes -- very -- a very pleasing young woman ."  <eos>   too much indebted to the event for his acquittal .-- no judge of his own manners by you .-- always deceived in fact by his own wishes , and regardless of little besides his own convenience .-- fancying you to have fathomed his secret .  <eos>   mr . weston , do not mistake me .  <eos>   she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish .  <eos>   " very well ," replied emma ; " a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better i shall be pleased .  <eos>   i was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well .  <eos>   you forget how time passes ."  <eos>   some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits -- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by harriet --( there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by mr . knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now ,) gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness .-- for her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of harriet ' s hopes should be enquired into ; and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right .-- rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of jane fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost .-- neither of them thought but of mr . knightley and themselves .  <eos>   the park would be open to him of course , and few navy officers , or men of any other description , can have had such a range ; but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure - grounds , is another thing .  <eos>   mr . churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife ' s : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence !  <eos>   it was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty ; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection .  <eos>   what ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing .  <eos>   sir walter was not very wise ; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel , that a more unobjectionable tenant , in all essentials , than admiral croft bid fair to be , could hardly offer .  <eos>   this was very wonderful if it were true ; and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot , already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to mary , of his being " a man whom she had no wish to see ."  <eos>   emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied ,  <eos>   " thank you , thank you -- but on no account .-- i would rather walk .-- and for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone !-- i , who may so soon have to guard others !"  <eos>   how it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell .  <eos>   that was all very true .  <eos>   " as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again .  <eos>   i shall leave you together .  <eos>   short letters from frank were received at randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans .  <eos>   remember how few minutes i was at randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and i am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery .  <eos>   she hardly knew yet what mr . knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- she even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .  <eos>   it was so with elizabeth , still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and sir walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing .  <eos>   how well you put it on !-- so gratified !  <eos>   i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible ."  <eos>   i shall press you no more ."  <eos>   " perhaps it is as well ," said frank churchill , as he attended emma to her carriage .  <eos>   " yes ," said mrs smith more doubtingly , " sometimes it may , though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe .  <eos>   the spring i always think requires more than common care .  <eos>   what a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure !  <eos>   or in the anxious supplement from mary , of -- " upon my word , i shall be pretty well off , when you are all gone away to be happy at bath !"  <eos>   jane ' s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma .  <eos>   you shall have a charming wife ."  <eos>   we must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man ."  <eos>   she had no difficulty in procuring isabella ' s invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention .-- there was a tooth amiss .  <eos>   " i rather doubt that .  <eos>   first , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man ' s youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man .  <eos>   it did , however .-- her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that mr . elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language .  <eos>   she went to mrs . goddard ' s accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was .-- she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred -- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks .  <eos>   in what respect ?  <eos>   it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley ."  <eos>   " brother and sister !  <eos>   harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till mr . elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess .  <eos>   what was his name ?  <eos>   mr . elton ' s situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet .  <eos>   she considered -- resolved -- and , trying to smile , began --  <eos>   it was well that he took every body ' s joy for granted , or he might not have thought either mr . woodhouse or mr . knightley particularly delighted .  <eos>   i give you this caution now , because i shall never speak to you again on the subject .  <eos>   the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas ; and as sir walter proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month , there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement .  <eos>   she rose early , and wrote her letter to harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that mr . knightley , in walking up to hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before .  <eos>   as to the management of their children , his theory was much better than his wife ' s , and his practice not so bad .  <eos>   " what is the matter , sir ?-- did you speak to me ?"  <eos>   he went to town on business three days ago , and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send to john .-- he delivered these papers to john , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley ' s .  <eos>   seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs . elton and jane fairfax were talking of .-- a situation , a most desirable situation , was in question .  <eos>   they were of sobering tendency ; they allayed agitation ; they composed , and consequently must make her happier .  <eos>   " i am here on no business of my own ," said emma ; " i am only waiting for my friend .  <eos>   when you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and i can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship .  <eos>   pray say so , with my compliments .  <eos>   she hesitated a moment , and then replied , " with you , if you will ask me ."  <eos>   i made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said mr . weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing ."  <eos>   " but every thing of that kind ," said emma , " will soon be in so regular a train --"  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   much better employed talking to the young ladies .  <eos>   a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction , as the most graceful set of limbs in the world .  <eos>   then she had , indeed , been a pitiable object ; for she had caught cold on the journey , and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain ; and all this among strangers , with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse , and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense .  <eos>   i will move a little farther off ."  <eos>   " if he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man ' s not having it in his power to do as much as that .  <eos>   that ' s what he did , and nobody else could have saved poor james .  <eos>   anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon .  <eos>   " i do not understand what you mean by ` success ,'" said mr . knightley .  <eos>   take your own ."  <eos>   her visit to abbey - mill , this summer , seems to have done his business .  <eos>   she could not think that harriet ' s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ;-- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- " mr . elton is so good to the poor !"  <eos>   said she , quickly , looking up in his face .  <eos>   harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father ' s footsteps .  <eos>   she must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable .  <eos>   " mary is good - natured enough in many respects ," said she ; " but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride -- the elliot pride .  <eos>   how could she have been so brutal , so cruel to miss bates !  <eos>   she held the parcel towards her , and emma read the words _most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top .  <eos>   he stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed .-- he was more in love with her than emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ?  <eos>   " i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome ."  <eos>   in a long strip of meadow land , where there was ample space for all , they were thus divided , forming three distinct parties ; and to that party of the three which boasted least animation , and least complaisance , anne necessarily belonged .  <eos>   can you seriously ask me , harriet , whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i was -- tacitly , if not openly -- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings ?-- i never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of mr . frank churchill ' s having the least regard for jane fairfax .  <eos>   so i begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , i could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for jane ; and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and jane said the same .  <eos>   she wished , however to see the crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned .  <eos>   she did all that i wanted .  <eos>   the child ' s situation put the visit entirely aside ; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference , even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account .  <eos>   " my dearest harriet !"  <eos>   what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy ?  <eos>   " thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend .  <eos>   we will not despair , however .  <eos>   he had his shepherd ' s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her .  <eos>   " i not aware !"  <eos>   " and mine ," said mr . knightley warmly , " is , that if he turn out any thing like it , he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing !  <eos>   you see how delightfully she writes .  <eos>   ` my dear ,' said i , ` i shall say you are laid down upon the bed :' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room .  <eos>   one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes , though i know you must fifty times .  <eos>   i could do very well without it .  <eos>   there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs . john knightley , in this short visit to hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister .  <eos>   emma thought first of herself , and then of harriet .  <eos>   " we were too magnificent ," said he .  <eos>   cried he , catching the same tone ; " i honour you !"  <eos>   he came four times a day for a week .  <eos>   " upon my word ," said she , " i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture , steady and matter of fact as i may call myself .  <eos>   emma woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .  <eos>   mr shepherd was all gratitude .  <eos>   but no sooner was the distress known to mr . elton , than it was removed .  <eos>   " it is not worth while , harriet , to give mrs . ford the trouble of two parcels ."  <eos>   she has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself .  <eos>   she had heard and seen it all ; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any .  <eos>   mrs . weston had been speaking to her at the same moment .  <eos>   emma could say no more .  <eos>   where _i_ sit is of no consequence .  <eos>   i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society i am got into .  <eos>   i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins , especially elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me .  <eos>   isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband ."  <eos>   as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them no service with sir walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of kellynch hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of sir walter ' s estimate of the dues of a tenant .  <eos>   how else could they come ?"  <eos>   pray sir ," turning to the waiter , " did not you hear , did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family ?"  <eos>   her own spirits improved by change of place and subject , by being removed three miles from kellynch ; mary ' s ailments lessened by having a constant companion , and their daily intercourse with the other family , since there was neither superior affection , confidence , nor employment in the cottage , to be interrupted by it , was rather an advantage .  <eos>   _she_ was not present when the suspicion first arose .  <eos>   mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the admiral ' s family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant .  <eos>   that will just do for me , you know .  <eos>   and so then , in my nonsense , i could not help making a treasure of it -- so i put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat ."  <eos>   " i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane .  <eos>   sir walter talked of his youngest daughter ; " mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter " ( there was no occasion for remembering mary ); and anne , smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was .  <eos>   he knew of no one but mrs . goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends .  <eos>   you and mr . elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes .  <eos>   a child on the watch , came towards them to beg ; and miss bickerton , excessively frightened , gave a great scream , and calling on harriet to follow her , ran up a steep bank , cleared a slight hedge at the top , and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury .  <eos>   he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air , just as he ought to have , and drew back from conversation .  <eos>   she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers .  <eos>   the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this mr musgrove , for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning .  <eos>   windsor - july .  <eos>   and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk ."  <eos>   i saw she had execution , but i did not know she had any taste .  <eos>   to be sure , the charade , with its " ready wit "-- but then the " soft eyes "-- in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth .  <eos>   she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston .  <eos>   but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr . frank churchill and miss woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that mr . weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest .  <eos>   ah !  <eos>   she cried with more thorough gaiety , " if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion .  <eos>   i doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady .  <eos>   everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of !  <eos>   she was actually forced to exert herself to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her .  <eos>   " it comes to the same thing .  <eos>   he had returned to a late dinner , and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over .  <eos>   then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day ."  <eos>   the consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been -- that had been -- hard for him to bear .  <eos>   i think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening .  <eos>   she hoped it was not so .  <eos>   here was a great deal to soften the business .  <eos>   you quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , i assure you mr . suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition ."  <eos>   you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate ."  <eos>   do the children grow ?  <eos>   i shall not discuss it here .  <eos>   she recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood .  <eos>   there cannot be two opinions about _him_ .  <eos>   miss bates and miss fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and mrs . elton seemed to think it as much her duty as mrs . weston ' s to receive them .  <eos>   he shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy .  <eos>   she had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late .  <eos>   i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; " don ' t do this ," and " don ' t do that ;" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them ."  <eos>   " middling , my dear ; i cannot compliment you .  <eos>   that very dear part of emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply .  <eos>   without his sanction i could not hope to be listened to again .-- i spoke ; circumstances were in my favour ; the late event had softened away his pride , and he was , earlier than i could have anticipated , wholly reconciled and complying ; and could say at last , poor man !  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   the present crisis , indeed , seemed to be brought on by them ; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct ."  <eos>   charles wonders what captain wentworth will say ; but if you remember , i never thought him attached to louisa ; i never could see anything of it .  <eos>   poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change ."  <eos>   i say , jane , what a perfect character you and i should make , if we could be shaken together .  <eos>   a large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabella ' s marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection .  <eos>   what blindness , what madness , had led her on !  <eos>   " where -- may i ask ?-- is miss fairfax going ?"  <eos>   captain weston , who had been considered , especially by the churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .  <eos>   i do not understand it .  <eos>   every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed , but every body ought also to be assured that mr . and mrs . weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated -- which is the exact truth ."  <eos>   " never , madam ," cried he , affronted in his turn : " never , i assure you .  <eos>   anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now , to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character ; and whether it might not strike him that , like all other qualities of the mind , it should have its proportions and limits .  <eos>   " are you serious ?"  <eos>   whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , i dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet ."  <eos>   he listened in perfect silence .  <eos>   emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence .  <eos>   i had not thought of mrs . dixon .  <eos>   a little while ago , he was at weymouth .  <eos>   first , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man ' s youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man .  <eos>   she had been particularly unwell , however , suffering from headache to a degree , which made her aunt declare , that had the ball taken place , she did not think jane could have attended it ; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill - health .  <eos>   it would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one .  <eos>   -- and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness ,  <eos>   and as to captain wentworth ' s liking louisa as well as henrietta , it is nonsense to say so ; for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best .  <eos>   they all seemed to remember the day , the hour , the party , the occasion -- to feel the same consciousness , the same regrets -- to be ready to return to the same good understanding ; and they were just growing again like themselves , ( harriet , as emma must suspect , as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy ,) when the carriage reappeared , and all was over .  <eos>   and , pray , who is charles hayter ?  <eos>   " you get upon delicate subjects , emma ," said mrs . weston smiling ; " remember that i am here .-- mr .  <eos>   perry ."  <eos>   ladies and gentlemen -- i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way .  <eos>   she touched -- she admitted -- she acknowledged the whole truth .  <eos>   " i lay it down as a general rule , harriet , that if a woman _doubts_ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him .  <eos>   the same story and the same raptures were repeated , when the two girls came with their father , through the gloom of the evening , to make enquiries ; and mr musgrove , no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir , could add his confirmation and praise , and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off , and only be sorry to think that the cottage party , probably , would not like to leave the little boy , to give him the meeting .  <eos>   she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to - day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself .  <eos>   i never was equal to this ."  <eos>   give me the book , i will write it down , and then there can be no possible reflection on you ."  <eos>   harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate .-- it might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke .  <eos>   a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line .  <eos>   there is no use in delay .  <eos>   there being nothing to eat , he could only have some play ; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother , he began to fasten himself upon her , as she knelt , in such a way that , busy as she was about charles , she could not shake him off .  <eos>   they must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that anne was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence .  <eos>   " i assure you she did .  <eos>   pray make my excuses and adieus to her ."  <eos>   jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of st . mark ' s place , venice , when frank churchill entered the room .  <eos>   if mr . knightley did not begin seriously , he was obliged to proceed so , for his proposal was caught at with delight ; and the " oh !  <eos>   " very well , i am much obliged to you .  <eos>   on one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others .  <eos>   i thought you were speaking of some man of property : mr wentworth was nobody , i remember ; quite unconnected ; nothing to do with the strafford family .  <eos>   emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney , and too stupid to rise .  <eos>   these were charming feelings -- but not lasting .  <eos>   mr . weston was to call in the evening , and she must return it by him .  <eos>   i will call another day , and hear the pianoforte ."  <eos>   you are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference ."  <eos>   what is all this ?"  <eos>   everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of !  <eos>   -- repeated mr .  <eos>   she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man , for she hardly knew what indisposition was ; and if he did not invent illnesses for her , she could make no figure in a message .  <eos>   " not at all , sir .  <eos>   " i mean to go with you , charles , for i am of no more use at home than you are .  <eos>   his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation , and he wants to talk to you about them ; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks -- oh !  <eos>   " these would have been all my friends ," was her thought ; and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness .  <eos>   he had always been lucky ; he knew he should be so still .  <eos>   " i dare say your apologies were accepted , sir .  <eos>   " he had better not be in a hurry .  <eos>   charles , in the meanwhile , was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt , now that he was so near ; and very evidently , though more fearfully , trying to induce his wife to go too .  <eos>   that very dear part of emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply .  <eos>   jane was quite longing to go to ireland , from his account of things ."  <eos>   there is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure !-- and the face not unlike .  <eos>   he has been opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping them open very inconsiderately .  <eos>   she was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance .  <eos>   and that ' s so dreadful !"  <eos>   after a short struggle , however , charles hayter seemed to quit the field .  <eos>   it is always the lady ' s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance .  <eos>   papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish , and i do not think you ever will .  <eos>   i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged .  <eos>   anne was to leave them on the morrow , an event which they all dreaded .  <eos>   dear miss woodhouse , do advise me ."  <eos>   " yes , very soon .  <eos>   but ( with a reproachful smile at emma ) she receives attentions from mrs . elton , which nobody else pays her ."  <eos>   no , my love ; but you will soon be tired .  <eos>   knightley .'  <eos>   so sudden !-- you may guess , dear miss woodhouse , what a flurry it has thrown me in !  <eos>   she must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman ' s scheme than an elderly man ' s .  <eos>   she looked down the randalls road .  <eos>   i have a great regard for you and emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence !-- at any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two ."  <eos>   lady russell loved them all ; but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again .  <eos>   some people were always cross when they were hot .  <eos>   leave it all to me .  <eos>   my mother ' s spectacles .  <eos>   compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent .  <eos>   i have a note of his .-- do not you remember , mrs . weston , employing him to write for you one day ?"  <eos>   he will rally again , and be happy with another ."  <eos>   ` woman , lovely woman .'  <eos>   and he is a very clever boy , indeed .  <eos>   i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman .  <eos>   does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench ?"  <eos>   how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her !"  <eos>   he looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added , " _she_ ought not to be angry with you , i suspect , whatever he may be .-- to that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , emma , that you did want him to marry harriet ."  <eos>   such confidence , powerful in its own warmth , and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it , must have been enough for anne ; but lady russell saw it very differently .  <eos>   but you know they were your own words , that _more_ wonderful things had happened , matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than between mr . frank churchill and me ; and , therefore , it seems as if such a thing even as this , may have occurred before -- and if i should be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to -- if mr . knightley should really -- if _he_ does not mind the disparity , i hope , dear miss woodhouse , you will not set yourself against it , and try to put difficulties in the way .  <eos>   let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour .  <eos>   " have you indeed no idea ?"  <eos>   it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way .  <eos>   it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other .  <eos>   we will follow them to hartfield .  <eos>   the subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike english , such as mr . knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father .  <eos>   as for herself , she might always command a home with lady russell .  <eos>   he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , mr . knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus --  <eos>   she could soon sit upright on the sofa , and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner - time .  <eos>   after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations , it was settled between charles and his two sisters , that he and henrietta should just run down for a few minutes , to see their aunt and cousins , while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill .  <eos>   it would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- i do not know that -- i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well ."  <eos>   married women , you know , may be safely authorised .  <eos>   after the note i sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one ."  <eos>   " what shall you do !  <eos>   " to be sure i am .  <eos>   " well ," said mrs . weston , laughing , " perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give jane such a respectable home ."  <eos>   only think if anything should happen ?"  <eos>   her objections to mr . knightley ' s marrying did not in the least subside .  <eos>   " i dare say ," replied mrs . weston , smiling , " that i thought so _then_ ;-- but since we have parted , i can never remember emma ' s omitting to do any thing i wished ."  <eos>   it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast .  <eos>   " it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected .  <eos>   it had not been possible for him to spend less ; he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot was imperiously called on to do ; but blameless as he was , he was not only growing dreadfully in debt , but was hearing of it so often , that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer , even partially , from his daughter .  <eos>   we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife ."  <eos>   i shall never forget it .  <eos>   you will never go to swisserland .  <eos>   as to captain wentworth ' s views , she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister , or impeaching his own honour , than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa , or louisa to henrietta .  <eos>   he could not forgive her , but he could not be unfeeling .  <eos>   harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure .-- her days of insignificance and evil were over .-- she would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous .-- emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted .  <eos>   she dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her .  <eos>   certain it was that she was to come ; and that highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- mr . frank churchill -- must put up for the present with jane fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence .  <eos>   harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion .  <eos>   but , charles , tell captain wentworth , he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me , for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend ."  <eos>   the scenes in its neighbourhood , charmouth , with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country , and still more , its sweet , retired bay , backed by dark cliffs , where fragments of low rock among the sands , make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide , for sitting in unwearied contemplation ; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme ; and , above all , pinny , with its green chasms between romantic rocks , where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth , declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state , where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited , as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far - famed isle of wight : these places must be visited , and visited again , to make the worth of lyme understood .  <eos>   she did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary ' s wrong , as mr . knightley .  <eos>   she could not be too soon alarmed , nor send for perry too often .  <eos>   emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him .  <eos>   it depends entirely upon his aunt ' s spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper .  <eos>   knightley !-- i could not have believed it .  <eos>   " perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before ."  <eos>   his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel wallis ' s companion might have as good a figure as colonel wallis , and certainly was not sandy - haired .  <eos>   " well ," said mrs . weston , laughing , " perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give jane such a respectable home ."  <eos>   the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch , and which she had felt slighted , and been compelled to smother among the musgroves , were now become but of secondary interest .  <eos>   compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words --" i had not a spare moment on tuesday , as you know , for miss woodhouse ' s beautiful little friend .  <eos>   at last , with some hesitation , harriet said --  <eos>   i have a very strong notion that it comes from him .  <eos>   " service !  <eos>   elton !-- no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him ."  <eos>   ay , so it always is , i believe .  <eos>   they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere ."  <eos>   what do you imagine his age to be ?"  <eos>   it depends entirely upon his aunt ' s spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   she received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which anne perfectly knew the meaning of .  <eos>   instances have been known of young people passing many , many months successively , without being at any ball of any description , and no material injury accrue either to body or mind ;-- but when a beginning is made -- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been , though slightly , felt -- it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more .  <eos>   to finish the interest of the story , the friendship between him and the harvilles seemed , if possible , augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance , and captain benwick was now living with them entirely .  <eos>   replied mrs . weston , smiling , " what is the certainty of caprice ?"  <eos>   she was his object , and every body must perceive it .  <eos>   a chaise was sent for from crewkherne , and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery - maid of the family , one who having brought up all the children , and seen the very last , the lingering and long - petted master harry , sent to school after his brothers , was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her , and who , consequently , was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa .  <eos>   however , when i read on , i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first ; and i make so light of it now to her , that she does not think much about it .  <eos>   an express arrived at randalls to announce the death of mrs . churchill !  <eos>   well !"  <eos>   he has imposed on me , but he has not injured me .  <eos>   but that would be all over now .-- poor fellow !-- no more exploring parties to donwell made for _her_ .  <eos>   were i to fall in love , indeed , it would be a different thing !  <eos>   and so excellent in the church !  <eos>   he came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it .  <eos>   " come miss woodhouse , miss otway , miss fairfax , what are you all doing ?-- come emma , set your companions the example .  <eos>   no , except when she thought of her mother , and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside , she had no sigh of that description to heave .  <eos>   do come in .  <eos>   no -- till cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head .  <eos>   louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister .  <eos>   one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties , and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house .  <eos>   yes , friday or saturday ; she cannot say which , because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days .  <eos>   god knows , i have been a very indifferent lover .-- but you understand me .-- yes , you see , you understand my feelings -- and will return them if you can .  <eos>   said i , ` i shall not forestall jane ; i left her dancing with mr . george otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was mr . elton , i do not know who will ask her next , perhaps mr . william cox .'  <eos>   you are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it .  <eos>   miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one .  <eos>   she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what mrs . goddard chose to tell her ; and looked no farther .  <eos>   emma must submit to stand second to mrs . elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .  <eos>   it stood the record of many sensations of pain , once severe , but now softened ; and of some instances of relenting feeling , some breathings of friendship and reconciliation , which could never be looked for again , and which could never cease to be dear .  <eos>   yes , i observed it , i assure you .  <eos>   mr . knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , " emma , you have been no friend to harriet smith ."  <eos>   a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , mrs . partridge , the lady i have always resided with when in bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with ."  <eos>   chapter vi  <eos>   it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object .  <eos>   weston , tell me at once .-- something has happened in brunswick square .  <eos>   how very odd !  <eos>   after a moment ' s pause , captain wentworth said --  <eos>   trust to me ."  <eos>   " only think !  <eos>   unwelcome as it was , mr . woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter ' s attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them .  <eos>   " it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but i cannot believe it .  <eos>   they secure an introduction .  <eos>   his tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as emma felt must draw every body ' s eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him .-- he moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble .-- whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave .  <eos>   this will be complete enjoyment ; and i do not know , mrs . elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house .  <eos>   as for herself , she might always command a home with lady russell .  <eos>   " you appear to feel a great deal -- but i am not aware how you or any of miss fairfax ' s acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than "--  <eos>   " don ' t class us together , harriet .  <eos>   no -- i am grieved to find -- i was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs . goddard ' s door , which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress , i was told that miss smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse .  <eos>   soon , however , she began to reason with herself , and try to be feeling less .  <eos>   " well , my dear ," he deliberately began , " considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and i dare say she was very much pleased with you .  <eos>   she desired nothing better herself .  <eos>   " perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut ."  <eos>   said mr . weston .  <eos>   the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again ; and miss smith receiving her summons , was with her without delay , and unattended by any alarming young man .  <eos>   " and had you really some at hand yourself ?  <eos>   mr . woodhouse soon followed ; and the necessity of exertion made him composed .  <eos>   and very nice young ladies they both are ; i hardly know one from the other ."  <eos>   they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley ' s .  <eos>   after securing accommodations , and ordering a dinner at one of the inns , the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea .  <eos>   the strength , resolution , and presence of mind of the mr . knightleys , commanded his fullest dependence .  <eos>   goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame .  <eos>   harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion .  <eos>   harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father ' s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder .  <eos>   i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions .  <eos>   " i declare , i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction !-- it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument .  <eos>   " only think of our happening to meet him !-- how very odd !  <eos>   he walked off in more complete self - approbation than he left for her .  <eos>   hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves ."  <eos>   " are you sure ?  <eos>   harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till mr . elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess .  <eos>   mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite , and on the present occasion , receiving her in that house , there was particular attention .  <eos>   she went to mrs . goddard ' s accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was .-- she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred -- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks .  <eos>   i can support her myself .  <eos>   but , charles , tell captain wentworth , he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me , for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend ."  <eos>   again , it was mary ' s complaint , that mrs musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the great house with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place .  <eos>   they had each had money , but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence .  <eos>   any other situation would have been much less in character .  <eos>   _she_ could not .  <eos>   contrary to the usual course of things , mr . elton ' s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion .  <eos>   " my dear frederick , you are talking quite idly .  <eos>   he is so very superior .  <eos>   you see how delightfully she writes .  <eos>   " had you ?"  <eos>   she expressed herself most willing , ready , happy to remain .  <eos>   if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child , i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like .  <eos>   adopt her , educate her ."  <eos>   but if you want to shew him any attention , my dear , ask him to come and dine with us some day .  <eos>   not handsome -- not at all handsome .  <eos>   some people were always cross when they were hot .  <eos>   it was a pity that she had not come back earlier !  <eos>   " you seem to me to have forgotten mrs . and miss bates ," said emma , " i have not heard one inquiry after them ."  <eos>   captain wentworth , who had caught her up , knelt with her in his arms , looking on her with a face as pallid as her own , in an agony of silence .  <eos>   ambition , as well as love , had probably been mortified .  <eos>   but she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ?  <eos>   chapter xvi  <eos>   i assure you i have .  <eos>   i like them extremely .  <eos>   here it comes .  <eos>   " no , i fancy not ," replied mrs . elton , with a most satisfied smile ."  <eos>   [ to mrs .  <eos>   " a material difference then ," she replied --" and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one - and - twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ?"  <eos>   the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ), had brought anne the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more .  <eos>   after tea , mr . and mrs . weston , and mr . elton sat down with mr . woodhouse to cards .  <eos>   i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business ; and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions , and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with .  <eos>   harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure .-- her days of insignificance and evil were over .-- she would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous .-- emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted .  <eos>   half a minute brought it all out .  <eos>   think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit mr . martin is nothing more ,) a good match for my intimate friend !  <eos>   with regard to captain wentworth , though anne hazarded no enquiries , there was voluntary communication sufficient .  <eos>   chapter i  <eos>   " by the bye ," said frank churchill to mrs . weston presently , " what became of mr . perry ' s plan of setting up his carriage ?"  <eos>   " i should not have thought it possible ," she began , " that you could have misunderstood me !  <eos>   ladies and gentlemen -- i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way .  <eos>   as a walking companion , emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her .  <eos>   as she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from mrs . goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring miss smith with her ; a most welcome request : for miss smith was a girl of seventeen , whom emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty .  <eos>   true , true , you are acquainted with miss fairfax ; i remember you knew her at weymouth , and a fine girl she is .  <eos>   my playing is no more like her ' s , than a lamp is like sunshine ."  <eos>   " and a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be ," continued he ; " asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , sir walter , i found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford .  <eos>   it was by no means his daughter ' s wish that the intellects of highbury in general should be put under requisition .  <eos>   " you mean mr wentworth , i suppose ?"  <eos>   my perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before ."  <eos>   one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal ,-- the ball at the crown .  <eos>   mrs . weston ' s communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax .  <eos>   i wish you may not catch cold ."  <eos>   i could not bear it for emma !-- emma is not strong .  <eos>   asked elizabeth .  <eos>   mr . john knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour .  <eos>   there was merit in every drawing -- in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same .  <eos>   " that is the case with us all , papa .  <eos>   jane will be treated with such regard and kindness !-- it will be nothing but pleasure , a life of pleasure .-- and her salary !-- i really cannot venture to name her salary to you , miss woodhouse .  <eos>   there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man .  <eos>   he was soon pretty well resigned .  <eos>   it was foolish , it was wrong , to take so active a part in bringing any two people together .  <eos>   i wish jane fairfax very well ; but she tires me to death ."  <eos>   sir walter , however , would choose his own means , and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation , regret , and entreaty , to his right honourable cousin .  <eos>   she was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers .  <eos>   there was some anxiety mixed with lady russell ' s joy in meeting her .  <eos>   i was very well yesterday ; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning .  <eos>   jane said so .  <eos>   i am very little able -- have you a chair , ma ' am ?  <eos>   we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain .  <eos>   i have quite a horror of upstarts .  <eos>   do not tell _me_ .  <eos>   how else could they come ?"  <eos>   the result of his reverie was , " no , emma , i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize .-- i never had a thought of her in that way , i assure you ."  <eos>   and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club !  <eos>   a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on anne ' s side produced nearly a cure on mary ' s .  <eos>   there is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance .  <eos>   when they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully !-- he seemed to want to be acquainted with her .  <eos>   in this walk emma and mr . weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived mr . knightley and harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way .  <eos>   what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged , and with manners so _very_ disengaged ?  <eos>   " you did behave very shamefully .  <eos>   " you had better explore to donwell ," replied mr . knightley .  <eos>   to that point went every leisure moment which her father ' s claims on her allowed , and every moment of involuntary absence of mind .  <eos>   " oh yes !  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   this emma felt was aimed at her ; and it made her quite angry .  <eos>   i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home ."  <eos>   i shall , therefore , set off to - morrow .'  <eos>   -- and in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded with , " he will soon be gone .  <eos>   so long ago as the 7th of november , ( as i am going to read to you ,) and has never been well since .  <eos>   her mutterings were chiefly to her husband ; and he murmured , in reply ,  <eos>   miss hamilton , now mrs smith , had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable .  <eos>   mr . knightley , i wish you had the benefit of this ; i think this would convince you .  <eos>   he cried , " i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together .  <eos>   but happily , either anne was improved in plumpness and looks , or lady russell fancied her so ; and anne , in receiving her compliments on the occasion , had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin , and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty .  <eos>   will not it be beautiful in her dark hair ?"  <eos>   he was a married man , and without children ; the very state to be wished for .  <eos>   she paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of .  <eos>   she was not so easily to be talked out of it .  <eos>   emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said ,  <eos>   i am tired of doing nothing .  <eos>   ."  <eos>   his recollection of harriet , and the words which clothed it , the " beautiful little friend ," suggested to her the idea of harriet ' s succeeding her in his affections .  <eos>   upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject , before the few who knew her opinion of mrs . elton , mrs . weston ventured this apology for jane .  <eos>   her making a fourth , when they sat down to dinner , was noticed as an advantage .  <eos>   no indeed i am not ."  <eos>   " i wish you may not get into a scrape , harriet , whenever he does marry ;-- i mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice .  <eos>   one is so fenced and guarded from the weather , that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted .  <eos>   said emma playfully .  <eos>   come , he knows himself there .  <eos>   warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , i am sure it will .  <eos>   i am quite ready .  <eos>   let them be sent to donwell .  <eos>   his company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week .  <eos>   i did not know that i had fixed a day , but as he says i did , i am going now ."  <eos>   " i hope she does .  <eos>   " no , i am sure it is not from the campbells .  <eos>   it was a gentleman ' s carriage , a curricle , but only coming round from the stable - yard to the front door ; somebody must be going away .  <eos>   but , as it is , the disappointment is single , and , i trust , will not be lasting .  <eos>   " so very kind !"  <eos>   as the blow was given , emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell .  <eos>   miss bates had just done as patty opened the door ; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to , pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good - will .  <eos>   she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs . elton ' s thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in miss fairfax ' s confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people .  <eos>   he does not think of the draught .  <eos>   -- " he was generally thought so ."  <eos>   i could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but i did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there .-- oh !  <eos>   peculiarly lucky !-- for as to any real knowledge of a person ' s disposition that bath , or any public place , can give -- it is all nothing ; there can be no knowledge .  <eos>   i never saw any thing so hard .  <eos>   cried emma feelingly .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " in all these cases , there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant .  <eos>   " jane !"  <eos>   say beautiful rather .  <eos>   cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours ."  <eos>   a short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period , and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners , and of seeing captain wentworth .  <eos>   he knew of no one but mrs . goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends .  <eos>   she knows i would not offend for the world .  <eos>   now they seemed in pleasant conversation .  <eos>   " take it ," said emma , smiling , and pushing the paper towards harriet --" it is for you .  <eos>   mrs musgrove had got mrs harville ' s children away as much as she could , every possible supply from uppercross had been furnished , to lighten the inconvenience to the harvilles , while the harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day ; and in short , it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable .  <eos>   in a low , cautious voice , he said : --  <eos>   he talks of you ," cried charles , " in such terms --" mary interrupted him .  <eos>   the looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all .  <eos>   but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way ;-- and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ?"  <eos>   what do you advise ?"  <eos>   had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now ."  <eos>   miss bates should never again -- no , never !  <eos>   mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming mrs charles musgrove ; but anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister ; her word had no weight , her convenience was always to give way -- she was only anne .  <eos>   captain harville had taken his present house for half a year ; his taste , and his health , and his fortune , all directing him to a residence inexpensive , and by the sea ; and the grandeur of the country , and the retirement of lyme in the winter , appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick ' s state of mind .  <eos>   you saw her with the campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on .  <eos>   mrs . churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for "--  <eos>   it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which i knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy .  <eos>   such might be his constitution ; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room -- and she humanely pointed out the door .  <eos>   emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself .  <eos>   one day last spring , in town , i was in company with two men , striking instances of what i am talking of ; lord st ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; i was to give place to lord st ives , and a certain admiral baldwin , the most deplorable - looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top .  <eos>   " he had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors ."  <eos>   no , he would sooner quit kellynch hall at once , than remain in it on such disgraceful terms ."  <eos>   " your first was the asp , i remember ; we will look for the asp ."  <eos>   in what respect ?  <eos>   " i rather hope to satisfy you both ," said emma , " for i shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic ."  <eos>   i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs . cole told us of it at dinner ."  <eos>   the good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me .  <eos>   charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of lyme .  <eos>   when she became sensible of this , it struck her that she could not be very much in love ; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father , never to marry , a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings .  <eos>   my playing is no more like her ' s , than a lamp is like sunshine ."  <eos>   so i got sophy to lend me a hand , and we soon shifted their quarters ; and now i am quite snug , with my little shaving glass in one corner , and another great thing that i never go near ."  <eos>   and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ` oh !'  <eos>   " i wish ," said mrs . weston , " one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best .  <eos>   " me !  <eos>   a little while ago , he was at weymouth .  <eos>   if ever there were people who , without having great wealth themselves , had every thing they could wish for , i am sure it is us .  <eos>   thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall , presiding and directing with a self - possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was .  <eos>   i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .  <eos>   asked elizabeth .  <eos>   she was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired .  <eos>   the frank churchill so long talked of , so high in interest , was actually before her -- he was presented to her , and she did not think too much had been said in his praise ; he was a _very_ good looking young man ; height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father ' s ; he looked quick and sensible .  <eos>   his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family , has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me ."  <eos>   suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us ?"  <eos>   harriet ' s cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of mr . martin , but to talk of mr . elton .  <eos>   one cannot creep upon a journey ; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one ' s friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs ."  <eos>   chapter xiv  <eos>   good mr . perry -- how is he , sir ?"  <eos>   it is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to ."  <eos>   i managed it extremely well ."  <eos>   everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters ; and sounds are quite innoxious , or most distressing , by their sort rather than their quantity .  <eos>   " at this moment , perhaps , mr . elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original , and after being asked for it five or six times , allowing them to hear your name , your own dear name ."  <eos>   " it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined !  <eos>   he was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter ."  <eos>   " you will not like him , i will answer for it ."  <eos>   this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives , as my father informs me .  <eos>   very unaccountable !  <eos>   i had not recollected it before , i declare , but it must be very bad .  <eos>   she had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman ' s return .  <eos>   " that is the case with us all , papa .  <eos>   if he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch , he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree .  <eos>   but whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a little longer doubtful .  <eos>   " _my_ report from mrs . goddard ' s ," said she presently , " was not so pleasant as i had hoped --` not better ' was _my_ answer ."  <eos>   i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins , especially elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me .  <eos>   emma denied none of it aloud , and agreed to none of it in private .  <eos>   her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emma ' s eyes -- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do .  <eos>   cried emma , after a moment ' s pause --" what do you mean ?-- good heaven !  <eos>   she plays charmingly ."  <eos>   " it is not now worth a regret ," said emma .  <eos>   her own conduct , as well as her own heart , was before her in the same few minutes .  <eos>   the worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment ' s thought , she hoped mr . elton would now be talked of no more .  <eos>   mr . elton must smile less , and mr . john knightley more , to fit them for the place .-- emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was .  <eos>   this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come .  <eos>   " but there may be pretty good guessing .  <eos>   when the plan was made known to mary , however , there was an end of all peace in it .  <eos>   but then patty came in , and said it was you .  <eos>   said mr . woodhouse , shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern .-- the ejaculation in emma ' s ear expressed , " ah !  <eos>   " but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm -- of the shock .  <eos>   she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ' s children ever were .  <eos>   yes , harriet , just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened .  <eos>   " she will not be surprized , papa , at least ."  <eos>   " a knock at the door !  <eos>   one set might recommend their all removing to donwell , and leaving hartfield for the john knightleys ; and another might predict disagreements among their servants ; but yet , upon the whole , there was no serious objection raised , except in one habitation , the vicarage .-- there , the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction .  <eos>   she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again , and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his .  <eos>   i wish jane fairfax very well ; but she tires me to death ."  <eos>   it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits , and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it .  <eos>   she had not advanced many yards from mrs . goddard ' s door , when she was met by mr . elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid -- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to hartfield -- they were overtaken by mr . john knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for .  <eos>   " she thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ?"  <eos>   i could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when i had really made a very good likeness of it --( mrs . weston and i were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like )-- only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side -- after all this , came poor dear isabella ' s cold approbation of --" yes , it was a little like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice ."  <eos>   events of every description , changes , alienations , removals -- all , all must be comprised in it , and oblivion of the past -- how natural , how certain too !  <eos>   there was a momentary expression in captain wentworth ' s face at this speech , a certain glance of his bright eye , and curl of his handsome mouth , which convinced anne , that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove ' s kind wishes , as to her son , he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him ; but it was too transient an indulgence of self - amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself ; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious , and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa , on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting , took a place by the latter , and entered into conversation with her , in a low voice , about her son , doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace , as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent ' s feelings .  <eos>   she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr . elton ; but he was actually hurried off by miss bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the coles , to usher in a letter from her niece .  <eos>   he was often hoping , intending to come -- but was always prevented .  <eos>   i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond ."  <eos>   she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict .  <eos>   " there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart ," said she afterwards to herself .  <eos>   she was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt jane fairfax ' s feelings ; and they followed the other ladies out of the room , arm in arm , with an appearance of good - will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each .  <eos>   while they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , i dare say .  <eos>   she repeated to herself again and again , in nervous gratitude .  <eos>   they are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body ' s hurrying away is no great compliment ; and miss woodhouse ' s doing it would be more thought of than any other person ' s in the room .  <eos>   with great indignation did he continue to observe him ; with great alarm and distrust , to observe also his two blinded companions .  <eos>   jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state .  <eos>   those letters are convenient passports .  <eos>   i wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough .  <eos>   -- then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , " well , now tell me every thing ; make this intelligible to me .  <eos>   he had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce mr . woodhouse to remove with her to donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of mr . woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father ' s comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded .  <eos>   he has those to please who must be pleased , and who ( between ourselves ) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices .  <eos>   upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly mrs . goddard , if not mrs . bates , might be depended on for bearing him company -- mr . woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter ' s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him .  <eos>   the folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view ."  <eos>   mr . knightley , however , shewed no triumphant happiness .  <eos>   _she_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings , and trying to understand the degree of her agitation , which she rather thought was considerable .  <eos>   " were you really ?-- well !-- but you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you .-- if i had been there , i think i should have made some discoveries ."  <eos>   " we shall never agree about him ," cried emma ; " but that is nothing extraordinary .  <eos>   she was not thoroughly comfortable herself .  <eos>   every possibility of good was before me , and the first of blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence .  <eos>   chapter xvii  <eos>   " no , i do not ; that is , i do not mean -- what shall i do ?  <eos>   miss anne , i cannot help wishing mrs charles had a little of your method with those children .  <eos>   while she remained , a bush of low rambling holly protected her , and they were moving on .  <eos>   she had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in the visit to london , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in this selection of mrs clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility .  <eos>   we had better leave the crofts to find their own level .  <eos>   " and i assure you , mr . weston , i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour .  <eos>   i am sure she will be here presently ."  <eos>   " it is impossible for me to doubt any longer .  <eos>   absence , with the conviction probably of her indifference , had produced this very natural and very desirable effect .  <eos>   i have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much , i am sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her ;-- william coxe -- oh !  <eos>   perfectly .  <eos>   it was so long since emma had been at the abbey , that as soon as she was satisfied of her father ' s comfort , she was glad to leave him , and look around her ; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation , more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family .  <eos>   yes -- she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has ;-- and there is the nursery for the children ,-- just as usual , you know .  <eos>   you see we have been wedging one leg with paper .  <eos>   suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way , and not able to ring the bell !  <eos>   nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind ;-- and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her !-- it certainly was very extraordinary !-- and knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more .  <eos>   no , i have no idea of being so easily persuaded .  <eos>   the weather added what it could of gloom .  <eos>   every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed , but every body ought also to be assured that mr . and mrs . weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated -- which is the exact truth ."  <eos>   jane ' s alertness in moving , proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   without that attraction , not all her money would have tempted elliot , and sir walter was , moreover , assured of her having been a very fine woman .  <eos>   supper was announced .  <eos>   ` you _must_ _all_ spend your evening with us ,' said she --` i positively must have you _all_ come .'"  <eos>   their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman ."  <eos>   i have quite a horror of upstarts .  <eos>   at the same time , however , it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin , and to know that the future owner of kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman , and had an air of good sense .  <eos>   there are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- offices for the sale -- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   no , upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body .  <eos>   such a heart -- such a harriet !  <eos>   he shook his head ; but there was a smile of indulgence with it , and he only said ,  <eos>   " it is very unfair to judge of any body ' s conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation .  <eos>   he sat a little while in doubt .  <eos>   lady russell began talking of something else .  <eos>   ay , so it always is , i believe .  <eos>   " you , sir , may say any thing ," cried mr . elton , " but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of miss smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit !  <eos>   anne had gone unhappy to school , grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved , feeling her separation from home , and suffering as a girl of fourteen , of strong sensibility and not high spirits , must suffer at such a time ; and miss hamilton , three years older than herself , but still from the want of near relations and a settled home , remaining another year at school , had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery , and could never be remembered with indifference .  <eos>   she is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly .  <eos>   intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question .  <eos>   in general he was judged , throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- mr . knightley .  <eos>   -- which you know shewed him to be so very .  <eos>   a very fine woman with a large fortune , in love with him !  <eos>   but it would not do ; he had not come to the point .  <eos>   emma and harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in emma ' s opinion , had been talking enough of mr . elton for that day .  <eos>   said emma again .  <eos>   " nothing at all .  <eos>   i had no intention , i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes , when i first entered the house .  <eos>   we never were so long without seeing her before , and as i was telling mrs . cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now ."  <eos>   how do you do , miss smith ?-- very well i thank you .-- and i begged mrs . weston to come with me , that i might be sure of succeeding ."  <eos>   they were all at her disposal .  <eos>   then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in cheshire ; how mentioned in dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of charles ii , with all the marys and elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto :--" principal seat , kellynch hall , in the county of somerset ," and sir walter ' s handwriting again in this finale :--  <eos>   a very fine woman with a large fortune , in love with him !  <eos>   she hardly knew what to say .  <eos>   " now , ma ' am ," said jane to her aunt , " shall we join mrs .  <eos>   when we talked about him , it was as clear as possible ."  <eos>   i think she would be so much pleased with his mind , that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner ."  <eos>   miss hamilton had left school , had married not long afterwards , was said to have married a man of fortune , and this was all that anne had known of her , till now that their governess ' s account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form .  <eos>   he could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap .  <eos>   it was folly to be disturbed by it .  <eos>   in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day , or poor mrs . weston would be disappointed .  <eos>   she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again , and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his .  <eos>   " yes ," said he , smiling .  <eos>   nobody could nurse her , as we should do ."  <eos>   emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about mr . frank churchill ' s not coming , except as a disappointment at randalls .  <eos>   harriet smith ' s intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing .  <eos>   no -- a very bad plan .  <eos>   " my dear mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself !  <eos>   i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see .  <eos>   anywhere , so that jane is not in a draught .  <eos>   she need not trouble herself to pity him .  <eos>   to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbell ' s power ; for though his income , by pay and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter ' s ; but , by giving her an education , he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter .  <eos>   the picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon after mr . elton ' s return , and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting - room , he got up to look at it , and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as for harriet ' s feelings , they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted .  <eos>   when people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , miss woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and mr . suckling is extremely fond of exploring .  <eos>   yes , i see what she means , ( turning to mr . knightley ,) and i will try to hold my tongue .  <eos>   my poor dear child , the truth is , that in london it is always a sickly season .  <eos>   " oh , no !  <eos>   " dear emma bears every thing so well ," said her father .  <eos>   she longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on mr . perry ' s coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery .-- there , with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw mr . knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her .-- it was the first intimation of his being returned from london .  <eos>   supper was announced .  <eos>   to that point went every leisure moment which her father ' s claims on her allowed , and every moment of involuntary absence of mind .  <eos>   but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling -- there was one person , i think , who must have felt it : miss fairfax herself .  <eos>   " you seem determined to think ill of him ."  <eos>   " i shall never be invited to abbey - mill again ," was said in rather a sorrowful tone .  <eos>   she could only resolve to avoid such self - delusion in future , and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell .  <eos>   mrs . weston said no more ; and emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat .  <eos>   two material advantages of bath over london had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from kellynch , only fifty miles , and lady russell ' s spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of lady russell , whose first views on the projected change had been for bath , sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there .  <eos>   her objections to mr . knightley ' s marrying did not in the least subside .  <eos>   but still he went on measuring , and still he ended with ,  <eos>   it was his idea to bring her to hartfield : he had thought of no other place .  <eos>   a thousand vexatious thoughts would recur .  <eos>   woman ' s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now ; or with no important variation .  <eos>   i was reading it to mrs . cole , and since she went away , i was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so i knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says ;-- but , first of all , i really must , in justice to jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half .  <eos>   she thinks nobody equal to him ."  <eos>   the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow , but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening ; and he came , bringing his friend also , which was more than had been expected , it having been agreed that captain benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   .  <eos>   how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her !"  <eos>   my perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before ."  <eos>   her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of ;-- but if he , who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two , were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away , it would be very distressing .  <eos>   there was one , however , which emma thought something of .-- the two last dances before supper were begun , and harriet had no partner ;-- the only young lady sitting down ;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder !-- but emma ' s wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing mr . elton sauntering about .  <eos>   you divert me against my conscience .  <eos>   do not be impatient , emma ; it will all come out too soon ."  <eos>   absolutely insufferable !  <eos>   the remaining five were left to their own powers , and emma doubted their getting on very well ; for mr . knightley seemed little disposed for conversation ; mrs . elton was wanting notice , which nobody had inclination to pay , and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent .  <eos>   we were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now .-- he is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity .  <eos>   that ' s a consideration indeed .-- but john , as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , i cannot conceive any difficulty .  <eos>   for one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do .  <eos>   his ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer .  <eos>   lady russell felt this break - up of the family exceedingly .  <eos>   " she had set out from mrs . goddard ' s half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at ford ' s ."  <eos>   south end is an unhealthy place .  <eos>   she listened , and found it well worth listening to .  <eos>   she thought so well of the letter , that when mr . knightley came again , she desired him to read it .  <eos>   how do you like it ?-- selina ' s choice -- handsome , i think , but i do not know whether it is not over - trimmed ; i have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed -- quite a horror of finery .  <eos>   she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict .  <eos>   they will soon be in yorkshire .  <eos>   i know what worthy people they are .  <eos>   " him !-- never , never .  <eos>   and here , instead of its being a matter of condolence , it turns out to be one of congratulation .-- i congratulate you , mr . weston , with all my heart , on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter ."  <eos>   " _my_ report from mrs . goddard ' s ," said she presently , " was not so pleasant as i had hoped --` not better ' was _my_ answer ."  <eos>   but with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all the present comfort of delay , there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with harriet , as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease .  <eos>   " this sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing ' s being dull and insipid about the house !-- i must be in love ; i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not -- for a few weeks at least .  <eos>   " i shall never be invited to abbey - mill again ," was said in rather a sorrowful tone .  <eos>   " we think so very differently on this point , mr . knightley , that there can be no use in canvassing it .  <eos>   " open the windows !-- but surely , mr . churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls .  <eos>   he did not boast , but it naturally betrayed itself , that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing , and on her laughing and noticing it , he owned that he believed ( excepting one or two points ) he could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing .  <eos>   " have i ?"  <eos>   isabella turned to mrs . weston for her approbation of the plan .  <eos>   can i do any thing for _you_ ?"  <eos>   do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience , when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties , which may be just as well performed by another person ?  <eos>   chapter viii  <eos>   he liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked .  <eos>   a few awkward moments passed , and he sat down again ; and in a more determined manner said ,  <eos>   it was a bad business .  <eos>   she could soon sit upright on the sofa , and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner - time .  <eos>   i do not see it ."  <eos>   " upon my word , emma ."  <eos>   harriet , mr . elton , and mr . knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them ;-- the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; mr . woodhouse ' s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing .  <eos>   -- i remember that perfectly ."  <eos>   how so ?  <eos>   " yes .  <eos>   but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place .  <eos>   good i am sure .-- i see it in your countenance .  <eos>   she would be such a delightful companion for emma ."  <eos>   no , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon .  <eos>   pray do not make any more matches ."  <eos>   their time and strength , and spirits , were , therefore , exactly ready for this walk , and they entered into it with pleasure .  <eos>   " i do not understand what you mean by ` success ,'" said mr . knightley .  <eos>   he did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day .  <eos>   he was in the trafalgar action , and has been in the east indies since ; he was stationed there , i believe , several years ."  <eos>   emma was just describing the nature of her friend ' s complaint ;-- " a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c . and she was sorry to find from mrs . goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them ."  <eos>   i shall leave off while i am well ."  <eos>   mr . knightley , is not she ?"  <eos>   he has walked with me , sometimes , from one end of the sands to the other , without saying a word .  <eos>   i had not thought of mrs . dixon .  <eos>   what a blessing , that she never had any children !  <eos>   pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once ."  <eos>   dear miss woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ?"  <eos>   " i am glad you think so ; and the good hands , i hope , may not be wanting ."  <eos>   the idea of mr . elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected mr . martin .  <eos>   mary talked , but she could not attend .  <eos>   " how delighted i am to see you again !  <eos>   once so much to each other !  <eos>   .  <eos>   emma woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .  <eos>   he hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets .  <eos>   they must encounter each other , and make the best of it .  <eos>   emma , who was not really at all frightened herself , tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs . goddard ' s experience and care ; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away , which she would rather feed and assist than not , she added soon afterwards -- as if quite another subject ,  <eos>   mr . churchill would never get over it ."  <eos>   she saw no reason against their being happy .  <eos>   a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities , or neither .  <eos>   am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smith ?-- that you have never thought seriously of her ?"  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness .  <eos>   she knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations .  <eos>   these were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present .  <eos>   i lived in perpetual fright at that time , and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself , or when i should hear from him next ; but as long as we could be together , nothing ever ailed me , and i never met with the smallest inconvenience ."  <eos>   she then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort .  <eos>   " how much i am obliged to you ," said he , " for telling me to come to - day !-- if it had not been for you , i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party .  <eos>   " i have very little to say for my own conduct .-- i was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased .-- an old story , probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding .  <eos>   my poor dear child , the truth is , that in london it is always a sickly season .  <eos>   how could she have been so brutal , so cruel to miss bates !  <eos>   my dear , it is not like hartfield .  <eos>   and dear emma , too !-- what a dreadful loss to you both !-- i have been so grieved for you .-- i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her .-- it is a sad change indeed .-- but i hope she is pretty well , sir ."  <eos>   it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that " of course it must be declined ," she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful .  <eos>   anne , attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to henrietta , still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet mary , to animate charles , to assuage the feelings of captain wentworth .  <eos>   mrs . weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but emma ' s countenance was as steady as her words .  <eos>   she read the concluding lines , and was all flutter and happiness .  <eos>   i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr . frank churchill , who is like nobody by his side .  <eos>   " do you dare say this ?"  <eos>   he had not seen louisa ; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview , that he did not press for it at all ; and , on the contrary , seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days , till her head was stronger .  <eos>   harriet bore the intelligence very well -- blaming nobody -- and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend .  <eos>   lady russell had only to listen composedly , and wish them happy , but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure , in pleased contempt , that the man who at twenty - three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an anne elliot , should , eight years afterwards , be charmed by a louisa musgrove .  <eos>   nursing does not belong to a man ; it is not his province .  <eos>   her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot .  <eos>   the friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm .  <eos>   so would poor little harriet .  <eos>   i never saw any thing so hard .  <eos>   as for me , my judgment is worth nothing .  <eos>   i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend .  <eos>   " not to my feelings .  <eos>   .  <eos>   the contrast between mrs . churchill ' s importance in the world , and jane fairfax ' s , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman ' s destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by miss bates ' s saying ,  <eos>   dear me !  <eos>   anne had called several times on her friend , before the existence of such a person was known in camden place .  <eos>   " and how could _she_ bear such behaviour !  <eos>   he cannot want money -- he cannot want leisure .  <eos>   i wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady .  <eos>   they had drawn back from many introductions , and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing .  <eos>   a miss hawkins --"  <eos>   " i wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too .  <eos>   miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have ."  <eos>   emma had hardly expected them : for mr . weston , who had called in for half a minute , in order to hear that his son was very handsome , knew nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking up to the house together , arm in arm .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse agreed to it all , but added ,  <eos>   " can you trust me with such flatterers ?-- does my vain spirit ever tell me i am wrong ?"  <eos>   " i have not said , exert yourself harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of mr . elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , i would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity .  <eos>   the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words .  <eos>   cried sir walter .  <eos>   frank churchill ' s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing .  <eos>   miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect .  <eos>   he is so very superior .  <eos>   " but still , not near enough to give me a chance of being right , if we think differently ."  <eos>   poor little dears , how glad they will be to come .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment .  <eos>   you will never guess .  <eos>   cried mr . weston , " about perry and a carriage ?  <eos>   but poor mrs . bates had a bad cold about a month ago ."  <eos>   every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home .  <eos>   what do you imagine his age to be ?"  <eos>   mr . elton certainly did not very well know what to say .  <eos>   but as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist mrs harville , i think it need be only one .  <eos>   on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented , she was soon spared all suspense ; for , after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary : --  <eos>   i shall do something to expose myself ."  <eos>   her ideas only varied as to the how much .  <eos>   she did not attribute guile to any .  <eos>   mr . john knightley must be in town again on the 28th , and we ought to be thankful , papa , that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country , that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey .  <eos>   she had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in the visit to london , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in this selection of mrs clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility .  <eos>   " very true , very true .  <eos>   it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage .  <eos>   elton was sitting here , i remember , much about where i am now ."  <eos>   she went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after box hill , when poor jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected .-- the fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name .-- she heard patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss bates had before made so happily intelligible .-- no ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , " beg her to walk up ;"-- and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient .-- emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging .  <eos>   mrs . weston looked , and looked in vain .  <eos>   a dinner at mr musgrove ' s had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by anne ; but she had staid at home , under the mixed plea of a headache of her own , and some return of indisposition in little charles .  <eos>   emma was out of hearing .  <eos>   " you mistake me , you quite mistake me ," she replied , exerting herself .  <eos>   she felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well - bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be .  <eos>   " almost every moment .  <eos>   vigorous , decided , with sentiments to a certain point , not coarse .  <eos>   but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand .  <eos>   miss woodhouse , why are you always so right ?"  <eos>   " but have you really heard of nothing ?"  <eos>   i doubt it .  <eos>   i want you to save yourself from greater pain .  <eos>   i thought i should have fainted .  <eos>   it was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because i remember thinking -- oh !  <eos>   think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit mr . martin is nothing more ,) a good match for my intimate friend !  <eos>   i may not have convinced you perhaps , but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr . dixon is a principal in the business ."  <eos>   he had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power , but he would never condescend to sell .  <eos>   emma ' s very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken the following day , by hearing that he was gone off to london , merely to have his hair cut .  <eos>   " do you think so ?"  <eos>   mr . suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove , and whose father had it before him -- i believe , at least -- i am almost sure that old mr . suckling had completed the purchase before his death ."  <eos>   i must have given you up ."  <eos>   she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy .  <eos>   " miss elliot , i am sure you are tired ," cried mrs croft .  <eos>   frank churchill ' s character was not desperate .-- she was his own emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of frank churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .  <eos>   the last office of the four carriage - horses was to draw sir walter , miss elliot , and mrs clay to bath .  <eos>   where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself .  <eos>   being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , i have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but i hope it all went off tolerably well .  <eos>   i am quite of your opinion .  <eos>   " it was her very particular friend , you know ."  <eos>   but i am a partial old friend ."  <eos>   you will soon , i earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself .-- no description can describe her .  <eos>   she gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme .  <eos>   for my temptation to _think_ it a right , i refer every caviller to a brick house , sashed windows below , and casements above , in highbury .  <eos>   mrs . elton eagerly interposed with ,  <eos>   from that moment , emma could have taken her oath that mr . knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument .  <eos>   but then there is not so clever a man any where ."  <eos>   men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed .  <eos>   and , pray , who is charles hayter ?  <eos>   with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively , with the real good - will of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did she then do all the honours of the meal , and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters , with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests .  <eos>   i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer ."  <eos>   i went .  <eos>   to your fine mind , i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification ."  <eos>   it is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed -- i mean by sight ."  <eos>   it would be going only to multiply trouble to the others , and increase his own distress ; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon .  <eos>   " the sooner every party breaks up , the better ."  <eos>   she heard him sigh .  <eos>   if they are not put off , he cannot stir .  <eos>   chapter xvi  <eos>   chapter xi  <eos>   i forget where we had been walking to -- very likely to randalls ; yes , i think it was to randalls .  <eos>   " when once married people begin to attack me with ,--` oh !  <eos>   this proves that he can leave the churchills ."  <eos>   it was badly done , indeed !  <eos>   miss woodhouse , what can we do about that ?"  <eos>   it is my party .  <eos>   harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emma ' s .  <eos>   yes , i am sure you are much too reasonable .  <eos>   mr . weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man ' s company .  <eos>   " you mistake me , you quite mistake me ," she replied , exerting herself .  <eos>   " there is one thing , emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution .  <eos>   or miss bates ?  <eos>   i remember her telling me at the ball , that i owed mrs . elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax .-- i hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss .  <eos>   i met him just now .  <eos>   very well ; time will explain ."  <eos>   " that i am sure you would .  <eos>   the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day at the cottage ; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot , the coach was beginning to be listened for , when the youngest miss musgrove walked in .  <eos>   when she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there .  <eos>   in this walk emma and mr . weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived mr . knightley and harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way .  <eos>   you would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- mr . cole is very bilious .  <eos>   the answer was , " oh , no ; never ; she has quite given up dancing .  <eos>   at the same time , i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware .  <eos>   mr . elton must smile less , and mr . john knightley more , to fit them for the place .-- emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was .  <eos>   i can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation .  <eos>   it was miss taylor ' s loss which first brought grief .  <eos>   i hope it does him some service with you ."  <eos>   do not let me lose it .  <eos>   mrs . weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world .  <eos>   ' tis a sad business ."  <eos>   there she is -- no , that ' s somebody else .  <eos>   no .  <eos>   " mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man , and in many respects i think highly of him ," said anne ; " but we should not suit ."  <eos>   asked elizabeth .  <eos>   she could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly .  <eos>   emma woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .  <eos>   there was no wound , no blood , no visible bruise ; but her eyes were closed , she breathed not , her face was like death .  <eos>   she felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well - bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be .  <eos>   i have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule .  <eos>   elton ?"  <eos>   " what does all that signify ?  <eos>   this could not be pardoned .  <eos>   miss bates , in her real anxiety for jane , could hardly stay even to be grateful , before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing .  <eos>   " my father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and mr . perry , whose name , i dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now ."  <eos>   they all united ; and , on reaching hartfield gates , emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him .  <eos>   while he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going -- her father began his inquiries .  <eos>   " to be sure , so it is .  <eos>   " if i did not know her to be happy now ," said emma , seriously , " which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , i could not bear these thanks ;-- for , oh !  <eos>   anne gave her credit , indeed , for feelings of great consideration towards herself , in all that related to kellynch , and it pleased her : especially , as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute , in the instant even of introduction , that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft ' s side , to give a bias of any sort .  <eos>   compare mr . martin with either of _them_ .  <eos>   mr . dixon ' s preference of her music to her friend ' s , i can answer for being very decided ."  <eos>   he is the very best young man -- but , my dear jane , if you remember , i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr . perry .  <eos>   it is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too .  <eos>   she hardly knew yet what mr . knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- she even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .  <eos>   the coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it -- so much consideration for her father .  <eos>   it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character , that no influence over it can be depended on .  <eos>   he seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her .  <eos>   then she had , indeed , been a pitiable object ; for she had caught cold on the journey , and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain ; and all this among strangers , with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse , and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense .  <eos>   " i was with mr . cole on business an hour and a half ago .  <eos>   the pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable .  <eos>   though better endowed than the elder sister , mary had not anne ' s understanding nor temper .  <eos>   a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance ; but not with a few months ended anne ' s share of suffering from it .  <eos>   " but she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite .  <eos>   " my first enjoyment ," replied john knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , " will be to find myself safe at hartfield again ."  <eos>   she had seen too much of the world , to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere , but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve , and would not use her ill ; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse , as a sister of her landlady , a nurse by profession , and who had always a home in that house when unemployed , chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her .  <eos>   the toils of the business were over , the sweets began .  <eos>   you will excuse me .  <eos>   -- repeated mr .  <eos>   had she followed mr . knightley ' s known wishes , in paying that attention to miss fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now .-- birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she ?-- supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into miss fairfax ' s confidence on this important matter -- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to mr . dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of jane ' s feelings , by the levity or carelessness of frank churchill ' s .  <eos>   they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere ."  <eos>   his letters disgust me ."  <eos>   jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off .  <eos>   mr . knightley had done all in his power for mr . woodhouse ' s entertainment .  <eos>   his mother and sisters were very fond of him .  <eos>   though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago .  <eos>   just like her !  <eos>   " perhaps she might ; but it is not every man ' s fate to marry the woman who loves him best .  <eos>   -- yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with mrs . weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners .  <eos>   " i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions , and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure , from living with those who have always set him the example of it .  <eos>   i should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path .  <eos>   " did you ever have your likeness taken , harriet ?"  <eos>   the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming --  <eos>   he shook his head ; but there was a smile of indulgence with it , and he only said ,  <eos>   true affection only could have prompted it ."  <eos>   he began speaking of harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before .  <eos>   dixon .-- very well .  <eos>   why does not he try bath ?-- indeed he should .  <eos>   she was vexed beyond what could have been expressed -- almost beyond what she could conceal .  <eos>   in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day , or poor mrs . weston would be disappointed .  <eos>   but harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself .  <eos>   " should i send it to mrs . goddard ' s , ma ' am ?"  <eos>   mrs . hodges may well be angry .  <eos>   you had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as i cannot be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine ."  <eos>   " yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of mrs . churchill , which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world ."  <eos>   behold him there , the monarch of the seas !  <eos>   such a number of looking - glasses !  <eos>   he had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs ; had heard voices , mirth continually ; thought they must be a most delightful set of people , longed to be with them , but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself .  <eos>   as to the management of their children , his theory was much better than his wife ' s , and his practice not so bad .  <eos>   said emma , as she turned back into the hall again .  <eos>   the heat was excessive ; he had never suffered any thing like it -- almost wished he had staid at home -- nothing killed him like heat -- he could bear any degree of cold , etc ., but heat was intolerable -- and he sat down , at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr . woodhouse ' s fire , looking very deplorable .  <eos>   she could only resolve to avoid such self - delusion in future , and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell .  <eos>   said she , beginning again when they were all in the street .  <eos>   when he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind .  <eos>   may its approval beam in that soft eye !  <eos>   can it be woman ?  <eos>   there was always sufficient reason for such an attention ; mrs . and miss bates loved to be called on , and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her , as rather negligent in that respect , and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts .  <eos>   captain weston , who had been considered , especially by the churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .  <eos>   he called her ` augusta .'  <eos>   chapter xi  <eos>   another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose ; but it was at the other end of the house , and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it .  <eos>   " no , papa , nobody thought of your walking .  <eos>   get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it ."  <eos>   now nothing !  <eos>   if he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , i dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had .  <eos>   " no ," said anne , " that i can easily believe to be impossible ; but in time , perhaps -- we know what time does in every case of affliction , and you must remember , captain harville , that your friend may yet be called a young mourner -- only last summer , i understand ."  <eos>   " when miss smiths and mr . eltons get acquainted -- they do indeed -- and really it is strange ; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently , so palpably desirable -- what courts the pre - arrangement of other people , should so immediately shape itself into the proper form .  <eos>   oh , no !  <eos>   it was too old a story .-- robert martin had probably ceased to think of harriet .-- they took a few turns together along the walk .-- the shade was most refreshing , and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day .  <eos>   suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us ?"  <eos>   she is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school .  <eos>   the last office of the four carriage - horses was to draw sir walter , miss elliot , and mrs clay to bath .  <eos>   to understand , thoroughly understand her own heart , was the first endeavour .  <eos>   " but you need not imagine mr . weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john .  <eos>   her health seemed for the moment completely deranged -- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , mr . perry was uneasy about her .  <eos>   they could not listen to her description of him .  <eos>   " very bad -- though it might have been worse .-- playing a most dangerous game .  <eos>   now , how were his sentiments to be read ?  <eos>   i am sure i have not got one half so good ."  <eos>   mrs . bates , mrs . perry , mrs . goddard and others , were a good deal behind - hand in knowledge of the world , but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged .  <eos>   mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent ; she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life .  <eos>   there , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit .  <eos>   compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent .  <eos>   harriet , harriet , do not deceive yourself ; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion .  <eos>   " this sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing ' s being dull and insipid about the house !-- i must be in love ; i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not -- for a few weeks at least .  <eos>   you were perfectly right !  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   ` my dear ,' said i , ` i shall say you are laid down upon the bed :' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room .  <eos>   she felt that , in quitting donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with .  <eos>   my mother is so delighted !-- for she is to be three months with us at least .  <eos>   a week had not passed since miss hawkins ' s name was first mentioned in highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when mr . elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her christian name , and say whose music she principally played .  <eos>   she had called on her former governess , and had heard from her of there being an old school - fellow in bath , who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering .  <eos>   he always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging .  <eos>   " you are expecting her again , you say , this morning ?"  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject ."  <eos>   anne found captain benwick again drawing near her .  <eos>   i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable ; and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden .  <eos>   freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him .  <eos>   the pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy .  <eos>   in mourning , you see , just as our mr elliot must be .  <eos>   if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman , i grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , i am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy .  <eos>   so seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , i suppose , actually lost !  <eos>   the invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like mrs . elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves .-- emma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and mr . weston , unasked , promised to get frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with .-- mr . knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and mr . weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come .  <eos>   a warm climate may be prescribed for her .  <eos>   anne , have you courage to go with me , and pay a visit in that house ?  <eos>   she did all that i wanted .  <eos>   " what is the matter , sir ?-- did you speak to me ?"  <eos>   " i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child .  <eos>   she spoke to him , ordered , entreated , and insisted in vain .  <eos>   in the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings ' coming had been united , such as the last accounts of mrs . churchill , whose health seemed every day to supply a different report , and the situation of mrs . weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child , as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it .  <eos>   " and no great harm if it does ," said mr . woodhouse .  <eos>   " she would have turned back then , but for you ?"  <eos>   she left it all behind her , all but the recollection that such things had been .  <eos>   it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject , and he said ,  <eos>   english verdure , english culture , english comfort , seen under a sun bright , without being oppressive .  <eos>   but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes ."  <eos>   at last , it became necessary to speak of her .  <eos>   " no , indeed you are mistaken ."  <eos>   it was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if perry had seen it ."  <eos>   " my dear miss woodhouse ," said the latter , " i am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while , and give us your opinion of our new instrument ; you and miss smith .  <eos>   jane ' s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her .  <eos>   was sir walter ' s cold suspicious inquiry .  <eos>   after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr . and mrs . suckling , the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn .  <eos>   till now that she was threatened with its loss , emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with mr . knightley , first in interest and affection .-- satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been .-- long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella .  <eos>   how very differently we feel !-- not think they will do each other any good !  <eos>   they are not at all nice children , in my opinion ; but mrs musgrove seems to like them quite as well , if not better , than her grandchildren .  <eos>   you do not think i could mean _you_ , or suppose mr . knightley to mean _you_ .  <eos>   how very odd !  <eos>   i never saw any thing so outree !-- those curls !-- this must be a fancy of her own .  <eos>   she could not think that harriet ' s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ;-- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- " mr . elton is so good to the poor !"  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   it would be a great comfort to mr . weston , as he grew older -- and even mr . weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense , the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home ; and mrs . weston -- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her ; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach , should not have their powers in exercise again .  <eos>   his father only called him a coxcomb , and thought it a very good story ; but that mrs . weston did not like it , was clear enough , by her passing it over as quickly as possible , and making no other comment than that " all young people would have their little whims ."  <eos>   understanding and gratification came together .  <eos>   " have you indeed no idea ?"  <eos>   his father had no apprehension of it .  <eos>   by birth she belonged to highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the fondling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations .  <eos>   if jane repressed her for a little time , she soon began again ; and though much that passed between them was in a half - whisper , especially on mrs . elton ' s side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects : the post - office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship , were long under discussion ; and to them succeeded one , which must be at least equally unpleasant to jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , and professions of mrs . elton ' s meditated activity .  <eos>   the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself .  <eos>   " yes ," replied harriet modestly , but not fearfully --" i must say that i have ."  <eos>   i know what thorough justice you will do it , and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect .-- i think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again ; but i will not delay you by a long preface .-- we are quite well .-- this letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness i have been feeling lately .-- i did not quite like your looks on tuesday , but it was an ungenial morning ; and though you will never own being affected by weather , i think every body feels a north - east wind .-- i felt for your dear father very much in the storm of tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning , but had the comfort of hearing last night , by mr . perry , that it had not made him ill . " yours ever , " a . w ."  <eos>   " mr . martin !  <eos>   she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance , and was beyond the reach of mr . weston ' s hint .  <eos>   with the help of spectacles .  <eos>   " thank you , but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , i do not wish to be giving any body trouble ."  <eos>   " yes , here i am , my good friend ; and here i have been so long , that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that i am waiting for my lord and master .  <eos>   i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr . woodhouse good ."  <eos>   the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his .  <eos>   " well , if he have nothing else to recommend him , he will be a treasure at highbury .  <eos>   miss churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of mr . and mrs . churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .  <eos>   this , to anne , was a decided imperfection .  <eos>   as she reflected more , she seemed but to feel it more .  <eos>   " you know i always cure you when i come .  <eos>   harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful .  <eos>   what an immense time mrs clay has been staying with elizabeth !  <eos>   i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together .  <eos>   volume ii  <eos>   in all their walks , he had had to jump her from the stiles ; the sensation was delightful to her .  <eos>   dick had been left ill at gibraltar , with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth ."  <eos>   i have been always telling you , my love , that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have emma ' s account , i hope you will be satisfied ."  <eos>   " when you have seen more of this country , i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield .  <eos>   but ah !  <eos>   " why , to be sure ," said mr . woodhouse --" yes , certainly -- i cannot deny that mrs . weston , poor mrs . weston , does come and see us pretty often -- but then -- she is always obliged to go away again ."  <eos>   harriet ' s cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of mr . martin , but to talk of mr . elton .  <eos>   emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first .  <eos>   mr . weston , however , too eager to be very observant , too communicative to want others to talk , was very well satisfied with what she did say , and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already .  <eos>   later in the morning , and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o ' clock dinner , the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again .  <eos>   till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar - bone was soon replaced , and though mr robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew ' s state , as to give the information of captain wentworth ' s visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before .  <eos>   was the reply , and with a look of surprise .  <eos>   this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened :  <eos>   he must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; i could not do such a thing .  <eos>   but that would be all over now .-- poor fellow !-- no more exploring parties to donwell made for _her_ .  <eos>   .  <eos>   " but you need not imagine mr . weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john .  <eos>   i know what is due to my tenant ."  <eos>   it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast .  <eos>   other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur .  <eos>   so sudden !-- you may guess , dear miss woodhouse , what a flurry it has thrown me in !  <eos>   if you prefer mr . martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ?  <eos>   her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the lodge , and to gladden the eyes of its mistress .  <eos>   replied he .  <eos>   i am sure mr . elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage ."  <eos>   " do let us have the pleasure of taking you home .  <eos>   we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a something more early implanted .  <eos>   happily it was not necessary to speak .  <eos>   he was silent .  <eos>   now , mr . knightley , a word or two more , and i have done .  <eos>   i am always watching her to admire ; and i do pity her from my heart ."  <eos>   " take it ," said emma , smiling , and pushing the paper towards harriet --" it is for you .  <eos>   " something a little inferior i shall of course put up with , but it must not be much .  <eos>   there was a family of cousins within a walk of uppercross , in less affluent circumstances , who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures : they would come at any time , and help play at anything , or dance anywhere ; and anne , very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post , played country dances to them by the hour together ; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove more than anything else , and often drew this compliment ;-- " well done , miss anne !  <eos>   he had done , and was unanswered .  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   they walked thither directly .  <eos>   " might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ?"  <eos>   ` can i do any thing for you at kingston ?'  <eos>   but consider -- you need not be afraid of delegating power to _me_ .  <eos>   she could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly .  <eos>   the coles were very respectable in their way , but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them .  <eos>   when he questioned , sir walter and elizabeth began to question also , but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt .  <eos>   there she is -- no , that ' s somebody else .  <eos>   they walked on .  <eos>   i could not have visited mrs . robert martin , of abbey - mill farm .  <eos>   -- but , said i , i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me .--` oh ,' said he , ` wait half a minute , till i have finished my job ;'-- for , would you believe it , miss woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother ' s spectacles .-- the rivet came out , you know , this morning .-- so very obliging !-- for my mother had no use of her spectacles -- could not put them on .  <eos>   they were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses , and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others ; but when the table was again safely covered , when every corner dish was placed exactly right , and occupation and ease were generally restored , emma said ,  <eos>   nursing does not belong to a man ; it is not his province .  <eos>   harriet turned away ; but emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up .  <eos>   as soon as he could , he began to talk to her of lyme , wanting to compare opinions respecting the place , but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time ; to give his own route , understand something of hers , and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her .  <eos>   with all the state which a butler and foot - boy could give , mr elliot was ushered into the room .  <eos>   one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one ' s own .  <eos>   anne ' s object was , not to be in the way of anybody ; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary , to keep with her brother and sister .  <eos>   i assure you i have .  <eos>   " i am afraid we must be running away ," said emma , glancing at harriet , and beginning to rise --" my father will be expecting us .  <eos>   " do you dare say this ?"  <eos>   a few minutes more , and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over .  <eos>   i shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when i return , i shall come to you for my wife .  <eos>   " don ' t class us together , harriet .  <eos>   there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are .  <eos>   perry tells me that mr . cole never touches malt liquor .  <eos>   dear , no ," said her companion .  <eos>   you are afraid of giving me trouble ; but i assure you , my dear jane , the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am .  <eos>   [ persuasion by jane austen ]  <eos>   good morning to you , my dear sir .  <eos>   henrietta was perhaps the prettiest , louisa had the higher spirits ; and she knew not now , whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him .  <eos>   i am sure we do .  <eos>   if mr . elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine harriet ' s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him .  <eos>   emma was pleased with the thought ; and producing the box , the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets , which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves .  <eos>   " i hope he will be here to - morrow , for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence .  <eos>   i was snowed up at a friend ' s house once for a week .  <eos>   " i am quite easy on that head ," replied mrs . weston .  <eos>   and so does poor mrs . weston "-- with half a sigh and half a smile at her .  <eos>   i hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set .  <eos>   chapter viii  <eos>   returned mr . knightley , with energy .  <eos>   they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together .  <eos>   pray do not make any more matches ."  <eos>   sir walter , without hesitation , declared the admiral to be the best - looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and the admiral , with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park , " i thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at taunton .  <eos>   mr . frank churchill did not come .  <eos>   it was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance .  <eos>   and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first ; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind , and sour the temper .  <eos>   she is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school .  <eos>   ford .-- " yes -- no -- yes , to mrs . goddard ' s .  <eos>   he could sing a little himself .  <eos>   " have you heard from miss fairfax so lately ?  <eos>   i would not have mr . knightley know any thing about it for the world !  <eos>   poor man !-- it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it .  <eos>   " most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty .  <eos>   it would only be giving trouble and distress .  <eos>   depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the donwell servants , who are all , i have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss .-- i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration .  <eos>   this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him .  <eos>   this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings .  <eos>   you order me , whether you speak or not .  <eos>   chapter vii  <eos>   it suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred on the very account of charles hayter , whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to .  <eos>   short of that , it is all guess and luck -- and will generally be ill - luck .  <eos>   he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do .  <eos>   " you seem determined to think ill of him ."  <eos>   the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriet ' s mind was not to be talked away .  <eos>   chapter xi  <eos>   you would not like to leave him yourself , but you see i can be of no use .  <eos>   let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of .  <eos>   it would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place .  <eos>   " i cannot agree with you , papa ; you know i cannot .  <eos>   she could do justice to the superiority of lady russell ' s motives in this , over those of her father and elizabeth ; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness ; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung ; and in the event of admiral croft ' s really taking kellynch hall , she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her , of the past being known to those three only among her connexions , by whom no syllable , she believed , would ever be whispered , and in the trust that among his , the brother only with whom he had been residing , had received any information of their short - lived engagement .  <eos>   an injunction of secresy had been among mr . weston ' s parting words .  <eos>   lady russell began talking of something else .  <eos>   his admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for mrs . weston , it would not have struck her .  <eos>   now , upon his father ' s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place .  <eos>   emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject .  <eos>   randalls is such a distance .  <eos>   anne could listen no longer ; she could not even have told how the poor admiral ' s complexion escaped ; her letter engrossed her .  <eos>   this proves that he can leave the churchills ."  <eos>   " well , mrs . weston ," said emma triumphantly when he left them , " what do you say now to mr . knightley ' s marrying jane fairfax ?"  <eos>   you are very kind .  <eos>   the child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible ; but what was there for a father to do ?  <eos>   louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with , and they would soon grow more alike .  <eos>   her mutterings were chiefly to her husband ; and he murmured , in reply ,  <eos>   tell your aunt , little emma , that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances , and that if she were not wrong before , she is now ."  <eos>   it will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever .  <eos>   " i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her .  <eos>   harriet , here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts .  <eos>   a fine place , but very retired ."  <eos>   it would be a great disappointment to mr . john knightley ; consequently to isabella .  <eos>   " what a precious deposit !"  <eos>   every thing declared it ; his own attentions , his father ' s hints , his mother - in - law ' s guarded silence ; it was all in unison ; words , conduct , discretion , and indiscretion , told the same story .  <eos>   " my dearest emma , do not pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a bad one , or to lay down rules for it : you must let it go its own way .  <eos>   look at the tree ."  <eos>   " you must make my apologies to your friend ; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two .  <eos>   " he told me at parting , that he should soon write ; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now .  <eos>   exactly so .  <eos>   he had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty - four , was still a very fine man .  <eos>   he brought all the music to her , and they looked it over together .-- emma took the opportunity of whispering ,  <eos>   mrs . weston undertakes to direct the whole ."  <eos>   it was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction .-- till yesterday , i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans .  <eos>   chapter ii  <eos>   it is bad for him , i know , to be shut up as he is ; but what can we do ?  <eos>   part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr . weston ' s on the subject , as much as possible .  <eos>   harriet looked grave .  <eos>   fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry , and miss jane bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl .  <eos>   " brother and sister !  <eos>   you are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference ."  <eos>   " nay , sir walter ," cried mrs clay , " this is being severe indeed .  <eos>   it is so with some men .  <eos>   as to the pretence of trying her native air , i look upon that as a mere excuse .-- in the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body ' s native air do for them in the months of january , february , and march ?  <eos>   she must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself .  <eos>   i had known the campbells a little in town ; and at weymouth we were very much in the same set .  <eos>   " perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle ."  <eos>   he did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment .  <eos>   " but will there be good room for five couple ?-- i really do not think there will ."  <eos>   and what is her attraction ?  <eos>   " no , certainly not ; i shall go home in the cool of the evening ."  <eos>   i have taken some pains for your sake , and for robert martin ' s sake , ( whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever ,) to get acquainted with her .  <eos>   " i have no conception whom you can mean , shepherd ; i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent ."  <eos>   they had not been long seated and composed when mr . woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter ' s attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last .  <eos>   isabella then went to emma ; but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away ; and they were still discussing the point , when mr . knightley , who had left the room immediately after his brother ' s first report of the snow , came back again , and told them that he had been out of doors to examine , and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home , whenever they liked it , either now or an hour hence .  <eos>   now mary , i declare it was so , i heard it myself , and you were in the other room .  <eos>   she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be .  <eos>   do put up your horse at the crown , and come in ."  <eos>   living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and colonel campbell ' s residence being in london , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters .  <eos>   and looked back , with fond regret , to the bustles of uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch .  <eos>   charles laughed again and said , " now mary , you know very well how it really was .  <eos>   forty ?"  <eos>   it will not do to _invite_ five couple .  <eos>   " highbury gossips !-- tiresome wretches !"  <eos>   i have a great regard for you and emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence !-- at any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two ."  <eos>   emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend ; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace , she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner , but could most heartily rejoice in that light , cheerful , unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure , in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection .  <eos>   her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour , and a dark bedroom behind , with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance , which there was only one servant in the house to afford , and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath .  <eos>   what were nine miles to a young man ?-- an hour ' s ride .  <eos>   yet he would speak .  <eos>   emma ' s answer was ready at the first word .  <eos>   though i think he had better not have married .  <eos>   happily , it was now time to be gone .  <eos>   " might he not ?-- is not it possible , that when enquiring , as you thought , into the state of your affections , he might be alluding to mr . martin -- he might have mr . martin ' s interest in view ?  <eos>   yes ; certainly ."  <eos>   for a little while emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say ,  <eos>   to know that _she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy .  <eos>   i do not like having such things so long in hand .  <eos>   her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour , and a dark bedroom behind , with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance , which there was only one servant in the house to afford , and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath .  <eos>   again , it was mary ' s complaint , that mrs musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the great house with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place .  <eos>   " certainly , if you wish it ;-- but you are not going to walk to highbury alone ?"  <eos>   don ' t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman ."  <eos>   he is a most charming young man .  <eos>   " she is not entirely without it , i think ."  <eos>   as soon as she came to her own name , it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself , by the natural return of her former regard for the writer , and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment .  <eos>   my right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question .  <eos>   well , mr . knightley , and so you actually saw the letter ; well --"  <eos>   and again , on emma ' s merely turning her head to look at mrs . bates ' s knitting , she added , in a half whisper ,  <eos>   eight years , almost eight years had passed , since all had been given up .  <eos>   indeed i think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley , who have been doing good all their lives , wearing out their last days in a place like uppercross , where , excepting our family , they seem shut out from all the world .  <eos>   ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit -- ( i can never think of it without trembling !)  <eos>   her curiosity was greatly excited .  <eos>   her face was averted from those who had made the attack , and turned towards her aunt .  <eos>   he had nestled down his head most conveniently .  <eos>   there was no wound , no blood , no visible bruise ; but her eyes were closed , she breathed not , her face was like death .  <eos>   she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbell ' s return ."  <eos>   invite them both ."  <eos>   she is a shrewd , intelligent , sensible woman .  <eos>   while she talked of his son , mr . weston ' s attention was chained ; but when she got to maple grove , he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to , and with happy smiles must hurry away .  <eos>   mrs . perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed .  <eos>   neither the dissipations of the past -- and she had lived very much in the world -- nor the restrictions of the present , neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits .  <eos>   i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion .  <eos>   " where could you possibly hear it , mr . knightley ?  <eos>   " you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am ; but still you must , at least i hope you must , think the better of him for it .  <eos>   you must have done well .  <eos>   anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different .  <eos>   half the sum of attraction , on either side , might have been enough , for he had nothing to do , and she had hardly anybody to love ; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail .  <eos>   but i ought to have gone before .  <eos>   surprizes are foolish things .  <eos>   " very well ; i will not plague you any more .  <eos>   miss woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone !"  <eos>   chuse your own degree of crossness .  <eos>   " the evil of the distance from enscombe ," said mr . weston , " is , that mrs . churchill , _as_ _we_ _understand_ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together .  <eos>   cried mary , her eyes brightening .  <eos>   mrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters .  <eos>   ( end of volume one .)  <eos>   captain harville had taken his present house for half a year ; his taste , and his health , and his fortune , all directing him to a residence inexpensive , and by the sea ; and the grandeur of the country , and the retirement of lyme in the winter , appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick ' s state of mind .  <eos>   " is she unwell ?"  <eos>   selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better ."  <eos>   nobody , who has not been in the interior of a family , can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be .  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it .  <eos>   there are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at mr . weston and harriet ,) whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing ."  <eos>   i remember saying to myself , ` even emma , with all her partiality for harriet , will think this a good match .'"  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one .  <eos>   they walked on .  <eos>   " i might not like them the better for that perhaps .  <eos>   mrs . smallridge is in a great hurry .  <eos>   she is always so attentive to them !"  <eos>   " they told me something ," said harriet rather hesitatingly ;" but it is nothing of any consequence ."  <eos>   of what sort ?"  <eos>   ( with a little sigh of sentiment ).  <eos>   " thank you , dear miss woodhouse .  <eos>   anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon .  <eos>   she had no doubt of harriet ' s happiness with any good - tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement .  <eos>   let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour .  <eos>   that very dear part of emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply .  <eos>   but i must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than i have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body ' s reserve to procure one .  <eos>   " you will see them yet , perhaps , before the morning is gone .  <eos>   what has mr . frank churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ?"  <eos>   ` my friend knightley ' had been so often mentioned , that i was really impatient to see him ; and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend .  <eos>   how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to him ?-- to have her haunting the abbey , and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane ?-- ` so very kind and obliging !-- but he always had been such a very kind neighbour !'  <eos>   all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath ; and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss fairfax ' s handwriting .  <eos>   the rest of the party were now returning , and all were soon collected .  <eos>   " walter ," said she , " get down this moment .  <eos>   emma was not sorry to be pressed .  <eos>   " no , i do not know that mr . wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except --  <eos>   mary deplored the necessity for herself .  <eos>   he had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery .  <eos>   " me !-- oh !  <eos>   what do you mean ?-- mistake you !-- am i to suppose then ?--"  <eos>   emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned .  <eos>   she was deeply ashamed , and a little afraid of his next look .  <eos>   with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross , it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination , her memory , and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible .  <eos>   harriet smith marries robert martin ."  <eos>   " i am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but i assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere , i am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming .  <eos>   there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs . weston ' s wedding - cake in their hands : but mr . woodhouse would never believe it .  <eos>   he must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; i could not do such a thing .  <eos>   dare say you heard the carriage , sir , while you were at dinner ; and going on now for crewkherne , in his way to bath and london ."  <eos>   that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man , and , moreover , a single man at the time , she had a fond dependence on no human creature ' s having heard of it from him .  <eos>   let us forgive each other at once .  <eos>   " as to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called nobody , it will not hold in common sense .  <eos>   --  <eos>   emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault .  <eos>   once only , when she had been grieving over the last ill - judged , ill - fated walk to the cobb , bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of , he burst forth , as if wholly overcome --  <eos>   it might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four -- they were now altogether ; but she could stay for none of it .  <eos>   he was often hoping , intending to come -- but was always prevented .  <eos>   if we were all like you , i believe we might sit four .  <eos>   " aye , very true , my dear ," cried the latter , though jane had not spoken a word --" i was just going to say the same thing .  <eos>   it confesses that you have long understood me ."  <eos>   she means it , i know ."  <eos>   conceive what the events of a week have done in that family !  <eos>   the intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by emma and mr .  <eos>   and how tired you must be after your journey !  <eos>   i assure you , miss anne , it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as i otherwise should .  <eos>   every body must have seen the snow coming on .  <eos>   good soul !  <eos>   emma ' s very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken the following day , by hearing that he was gone off to london , merely to have his hair cut .  <eos>   the same story and the same raptures were repeated , when the two girls came with their father , through the gloom of the evening , to make enquiries ; and mr musgrove , no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir , could add his confirmation and praise , and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off , and only be sorry to think that the cottage party , probably , would not like to leave the little boy , to give him the meeting .  <eos>   sometimes mr . elton predominated , sometimes the martins ; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other .  <eos>   " in one respect , perhaps , mr . elton ' s manners are superior to mr . knightley ' s or mr . weston ' s .  <eos>   she was most forcibly struck .  <eos>   he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner ; and having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books before him , mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right , and talked , with grave faces , of his studying himself to death .  <eos>   no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper .  <eos>   but is it possible that you had no suspicion ?-- i mean of late .  <eos>   ` it is only mrs . cole ,' said i , ` depend upon it .  <eos>   she will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home .  <eos>   knightley .-- every other part of her mind was disgusting .  <eos>   neither the dissipations of the past -- and she had lived very much in the world -- nor the restrictions of the present , neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits .  <eos>   mr . martin is a very respectable young man , but i cannot admit him to be harriet ' s equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her .  <eos>   give me the paper and listen .  <eos>   but he hoped he should in time ."  <eos>   they praised the morning ; gloried in the sea ; sympathized in the delight of the fresh - feeling breeze -- and were silent ; till henrietta suddenly began again with --  <eos>   she was out ; and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in .  <eos>   dear , no , never ."  <eos>   if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman , i grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , i am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy .  <eos>   we will not be parted .  <eos>   we never see any thing of it on our club - nights ."  <eos>   -- and as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth .  <eos>   " so obliged to you !-- so very much obliged to you for the carriage ," resumed miss bates .  <eos>   what was to be done ?  <eos>   perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but mr . weston had been almost as uneasy as herself .-- in ten minutes , however , the child had been perfectly well again .  <eos>   now , i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea .  <eos>   that was your doing , papa .  <eos>   -- repeated frank churchill , with a look of surprize and displeasure .-- " that is easy -- but miss fairfax does not disapprove it , i suppose ."  <eos>   that it was time for every body to go , concluded the subject ; and with a short final arrangement for the next day ' s scheme , they parted .  <eos>   whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof ; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each ; they could not but be reverted to ; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him , in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   which of them is it ?-- i charge you by all that is sacred , not to attempt concealment ."  <eos>   he had called in camden place ; had called a second time , a third ; had been pointedly attentive .  <eos>   " six years hence !  <eos>   suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us ?"  <eos>   " very soon , very soon , indeed ; that ' s the worst of it .  <eos>   " well , mrs . weston ," said emma triumphantly when he left them , " what do you say now to mr . knightley ' s marrying jane fairfax ?"  <eos>   " only four - and - twenty .  <eos>   she bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause .  <eos>   we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days ."  <eos>   but why so ?-- i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too ."  <eos>   he was gone immediately ; and emma soon saw him standing before miss fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of miss fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing .  <eos>   till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar - bone was soon replaced , and though mr robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew ' s state , as to give the information of captain wentworth ' s visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before .  <eos>   she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing .  <eos>   well , i was persuaded there were two .  <eos>   and unfortunately " ( speaking low and tremulously ) " there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late ."  <eos>   mr elliot , too , it must be remembered , had not been a widower seven months .  <eos>   " he told me at parting , that he should soon write ; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now .  <eos>   emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush .  <eos>   i suppose " ( smiling ) " i have more pride than any of you ; but i confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them ."  <eos>   one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance .  <eos>   the persons to be invited , required little thought .  <eos>   " thank you , thank you -- but on no account .-- i would rather walk .-- and for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone !-- i , who may so soon have to guard others !"  <eos>   no , he could not believe it a bad house ; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having .  <eos>   there was no superiority of manner , accomplishment , or understanding .  <eos>   mr elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open .  <eos>   an excellent charade indeed !  <eos>   anne found a nice seat for her , on a dry sunny bank , under the hedge - row , in which she had no doubt of their still being , in some spot or other .  <eos>   all looked up to them .  <eos>   here was a fortune at once ; besides which , there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war ; and he was sure captain wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy .  <eos>   he stopped .-- emma felt her foot pressed by mrs . weston , and did not herself know what to think .  <eos>   she knows nothing herself , and looks upon emma as knowing every thing .  <eos>   two months must bring it to the proof .  <eos>   i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing .  <eos>   as yet , you have seen nothing of bath .  <eos>   anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches .  <eos>   my blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of , and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier ."  <eos>   i believe he is one of the very best - tempered men that ever existed .  <eos>   though now the middle of december , there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; and on the morrow , emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family , who lived a little way out of highbury .  <eos>   mary had had her evils ; but upon the whole , as was evident by her staying so long , she had found more to enjoy than to suffer .  <eos>   my perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before ."  <eos>   when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about !  <eos>   she was reminded , more than once , of having always said she would never marry , and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single ; and told of poor isabella , and poor miss taylor .-- but it would not do .  <eos>   mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot ' s knock ."  <eos>   her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but harriet could not tell .  <eos>   selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly .  <eos>   his father had no apprehension of it .  <eos>   i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together .  <eos>   you are not serious ?  <eos>   the harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at uppercross , whenever she returned .  <eos>   no .  <eos>   " at this moment , perhaps , mr . elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original , and after being asked for it five or six times , allowing them to hear your name , your own dear name ."  <eos>   chapter ii  <eos>   however , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother ' s time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here .  <eos>   the sight of mrs clay in such favour , and of anne so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed .  <eos>   " no , ma ' am , he did not mention no particular family ; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman , and would be a baronight some day ."  <eos>   the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before ."  <eos>   and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfax ' s sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , " this is very bad .-- he had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily .-- she must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could .  <eos>   " i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me .  <eos>   the cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time .  <eos>   immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them .  <eos>   anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech , and entered into the subject , as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man , though here it was good of a lower standard , for what could be offered but general acquiescence ?  <eos>   how will a conundrum reckon ?"  <eos>   " indeed !  <eos>   well , mrs . weston , you have prevailed , i hope , and these ladies will oblige us ."  <eos>   her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given .  <eos>   he knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away .  <eos>   mr . weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife ;-- and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ?"  <eos>   " she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one ' s eyes from .  <eos>   very well ; time will explain ."  <eos>   they might advance rapidly if they would , however ; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no .  <eos>   it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to mr . knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them ,--  <eos>   one cannot have too large a party .  <eos>   indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend .  <eos>   elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her , and indignantly answered for each party ' s perfectly knowing their situation .  <eos>   the crofts took possession with true naval alertness , and were to be visited .  <eos>   " success supposes endeavour .  <eos>   henrietta fully thought so herself , before captain wentworth came ; but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by , and mr . weston , with a very good grace , immediately exclaimed ,  <eos>   there was no comfort in having him in london ; he might as well be at enscombe ; but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse .  <eos>   i know it has .  <eos>   " yes ," said mrs smith more doubtingly , " sometimes it may , though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   if you value her conduct or happiness , infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can .  <eos>   " aye , i see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte .  <eos>   that ' s a consideration indeed .-- but john , as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , i cannot conceive any difficulty .  <eos>   " i shall hear about you all ," said he ; " that is my chief consolation .  <eos>   let us be discreet -- quite on our good behaviour .-- hush !-- you remember those lines -- i forget the poem at this moment :  <eos>   she had a large acquaintance , of course professionally , among those who can afford to buy , and she disposes of my merchandise .  <eos>   he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long , and which had been the home of his father ' s father ; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living , walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other ; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit , they shewed , altogether , a good - will towards highbury in general , which must be very like a merit to those he was with .  <eos>   it was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life .  <eos>   he had , very soon after their engagement ceased , got employ : and all that he had told her would follow , had taken place .  <eos>   the miss musgroves agreed to it ; and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could , they returned to the breakfast table .  <eos>   he had time only to say ,  <eos>   but so eager and so resolute !  <eos>   when you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and i can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship .  <eos>   " yes , that of course ."  <eos>   happily for her , they were not many .  <eos>   mr . elton ' s situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet .  <eos>   but first of all , there must be an answer written to mrs .  <eos>   she often says , when the letter is first opened , ` well , hetty , now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work '-- don ' t you , ma ' am ?-- and then i tell her , i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her -- every word of it -- i am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word .  <eos>   " i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , mr . knightley , if i take the liberty ( i consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma ' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smith ' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you .  <eos>   jane fairfax ' s perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged .  <eos>   as to being anne ' s acquaintance ," said mary , " i think he is rather my acquaintance , for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight ."  <eos>   he was no dancer in general .  <eos>   while well , and happy , and properly attended to , she had great good humour and excellent spirits ; but any indisposition sunk her completely .  <eos>   " when you have seen more of this country , i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield .  <eos>   in a few minutes the carriage returned .-- somebody talked of rain .-- " i will see that there are umbrellas , sir ," said frank to his father : " miss bates must not be forgotten :" and away he went .  <eos>   cried mr .  <eos>   its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind -- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation .  <eos>   it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were .-- she should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here .-- he was expected back every day .  <eos>   " for my companion tells me ," said she , " that i absolutely promised miss bates last night , that i would come this morning .  <eos>   such as mrs . elton appeared to her on this second interview , such she appeared whenever they met again ,-- self - important , presuming , familiar , ignorant , and ill - bred .  <eos>   excepting yourself and your brother , i do not know his equal for temper .  <eos>   miss smith , and miss bickerton , another parlour boarder at mrs . goddard ' s , who had been also at the ball , had walked out together , and taken a road , the richmond road , which , though apparently public enough for safety , had led them into alarm .-- about half a mile beyond highbury , making a sudden turn , and deeply shaded by elms on each side , it became for a considerable stretch very retired ; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it , they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them , on a broader patch of greensward by the side , a party of gipsies .  <eos>   " but they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much .  <eos>   yes .  <eos>   -- yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with mrs . weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners .  <eos>   " and if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again ."  <eos>   do not let us be too solemn on the business .  <eos>   but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us again , so near as town .  <eos>   " i dare say they are , sir .  <eos>   " i rather doubt that .  <eos>   " from the very circumstance of its being larger , sir .  <eos>   i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town .  <eos>   does she never mean to go away ?  <eos>   and ever since she was twelve , emma has been mistress of the house and of you all .  <eos>   " leave it to me .  <eos>   he might observe that it was so .  <eos>   it was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than i could bear ; and so i never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in brunswick square ;-- and , as i said , i did then forswear ever drawing any body again .  <eos>   he had never had an idea of throwing himself off ; he had feared that he was thrown off , but knew not why , and delicacy had kept him silent .  <eos>   his face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered .  <eos>   if i loved a man , as she loves the admiral , i would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and i would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else ."  <eos>   mr shepherd laughed , as he knew he must , at this wit , and then added --  <eos>   the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter , had proved erroneous ; no friends had deserted them , no pleasures had been lost .-- but her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction .  <eos>   i always take the part of my own sex .  <eos>   frank was standing by her , but not steadily ; there was a restlessness , which shewed a mind not at ease .  <eos>   there , it is done .  <eos>   " when i have seen mr . elton ," replied jane , " i dare say i shall be interested -- but i believe it requires _that_ with me .  <eos>   mr and mrs musgrove took me , and we were so crowded !  <eos>   but we never did .  <eos>   he had a great regard for mrs . goddard ; and emma should write a line , and invite her .  <eos>   that is quite -- i suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting .  <eos>   she must be taken to their house ; all must go to their house ; and await the surgeon ' s arrival there .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it .  <eos>   i am not prejudiced ."  <eos>   with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; of judging of his general manners , and by inference , of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be , who were now seeing them together for the first time .  <eos>   while he was so dull , it was no wonder that harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable .  <eos>   she was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited mr . woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip .  <eos>   it was his idea to bring her to hartfield : he had thought of no other place .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   i do not understand it .  <eos>   mrs . elton had most kindly sent jane a note , or we should have been .-- but two such offers in one day !-- never were such neighbours .  <eos>   " well , my dear jane , i believe we must be running away .  <eos>   the strength of the song falls on the second ."  <eos>   " she would rather not be in his company more than she could help .  <eos>   captain wentworth turned in to call on his friend ; the others walked on , and he was to join them on the cobb .  <eos>   they were so deserving , that a _little_ higher should have been enough : but as it was , how could she have done otherwise ?-- impossible !-- she could not repent .  <eos>   such an aunt !"  <eos>   it would be dreadful to be standing so close !  <eos>   " poor dear fellow !"  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   in no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance .  <eos>   he told me it was to be a great secret ; and , therefore , i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you , but he said you knew it ."  <eos>   anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house ; and louisa , by whom she found herself walking , burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy ; their friendliness , their brotherliness , their openness , their uprightness ; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england ; that they only knew how to live , and they only deserved to be respected and loved .  <eos>   but she is really quite the gentlewoman ."  <eos>   she spoke as she felt , with earnest regret and solicitude -- sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for miss fairfax ' s advantage and comfort as possible .  <eos>   i really wish you to call with me .  <eos>   i come in for a pretty good share as a second .  <eos>   ."  <eos>   how trifling they make every thing else appear !-- i feel now as if i could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day ; and yet , who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind ?"  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   a little upstart , vulgar being , with her mr . e ., and her _caro_ _sposo_ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery .  <eos>   he would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would .  <eos>   " but , my dear , pray do not make any more matches ; they are silly things , and break up one ' s family circle grievously ."  <eos>   but i shall want the ribbon directly -- so it had better go to hartfield -- at least the ribbon .  <eos>   we shall only be making each other more angry .  <eos>   i say , jane , what a perfect character you and i should make , if we could be shaken together .  <eos>   " well , my dear , and did you get there safely ?-- and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter ?-- i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming .  <eos>   emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him .  <eos>   if he means any thing , it must be to please you .  <eos>   " i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them -- certain expressive looks , which i did not believe meant to be public ."  <eos>   " i would not go away without seeing you , but i have no time to spare , and therefore must now be gone directly .  <eos>   captain weston , who had been considered , especially by the churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " him !-- never , never .  <eos>   she is always so attentive to them !"  <eos>   anne was to leave them on the morrow , an event which they all dreaded .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " it would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ?"  <eos>   " for shame , emma !  <eos>   " i lay it down as a general rule , harriet , that if a woman _doubts_ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him .  <eos>   and , in short , from knowing his usual ways , i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all .  <eos>   he proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , i was convinced he could not do better .  <eos>   " depend upon me -- but ask no more questions .  <eos>   he wanted her to look up and smile ; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly -- she did -- cheerfully answering ,  <eos>   the corner of the sofa is very good .  <eos>   tell me how miss fairfax is ."  <eos>   they spoke , therefore , of mrs . churchill ' s death with mutual forbearance .  <eos>   he had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but emma ' s feelings were chiefly with jane , in the argument ; and on leaving randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of mr . knightley ' s high superiority of character .  <eos>   miss bates , deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner , did not immediately catch her meaning ; but , when it burst on her , it could not anger , though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her .  <eos>   his perception of the striking improvement of harriet ' s manner , since her introduction at hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment .  <eos>   women of that class have great opportunities , and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to .  <eos>   i never shall forget his manner .  <eos>   the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from mr . elton to mr . woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with mr . elton ' s best compliments , " that he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of mr . woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense -- and had mr . woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them ."  <eos>   her health seemed for the moment completely deranged -- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , mr . perry was uneasy about her .  <eos>   mr . knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , mr . woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the bates ' s , said --  <eos>   she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her ;-- _she_ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner ,  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " when once married people begin to attack me with ,--` oh !  <eos>   " now you are taking nonsense , mary ," was therefore his answer .  <eos>   poor mr . elton !  <eos>   as louisa improved , he had improved , and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week .  <eos>   ` elegance , sweetness , beauty .'  <eos>   mr elliot had attempted no apology , and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family , as sir walter considered him unworthy of it : all acquaintance between them had ceased .  <eos>   she ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriet ' s share .  <eos>   there will not be time for any thing ."  <eos>   it succeeded , however ; and though sir walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house , and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms , he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty , and authorising him to wait on admiral croft , who still remained at taunton , and fix a day for the house being seen .  <eos>   said emma .  <eos>   it was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults , what would mr . churchill do without her ?  <eos>   there are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at mr . weston and harriet ,) whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing ."  <eos>   she wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into mr . and mrs . weston ' s disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship .  <eos>   they ought to be setting off for uppercross by one , and in the mean while were to be all together , and out of doors as long as they could .  <eos>   i declare , anne , he never talks of you at all ."  <eos>   miss woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again ."  <eos>   " the navy , i think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give .  <eos>   while he was so dull , it was no wonder that harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable .  <eos>   " no , indeed , i have no doubts at all on that head .  <eos>   i think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him ."  <eos>   lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all , wondered , grieved , and feared ; and the affront it contained to anne , in mrs clay ' s being of so much use , while anne could be of none , was a very sore aggravation .  <eos>   " so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax ?"  <eos>   so much superadded decision of character !  <eos>   there was not a baronet from a to z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal .  <eos>   cried harriet , warmly .  <eos>   a most suitable connection everybody must consider it , but i think it might be a very happy one ."  <eos>   " charming miss woodhouse !  <eos>   " what !  <eos>   she had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath .  <eos>   " but , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is april , and june , or say even july , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us .  <eos>   " it will not do ," whispered frank to emma ; " they are most of them affronted .  <eos>   and so forth -- i always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see .  <eos>   mr . elton knows you ."  <eos>   they were soon dining in company together at mr musgrove ' s , for the little boy ' s state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself ; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings .  <eos>   " so unreasonably early !"  <eos>   he had not forgiven anne elliot .  <eos>   he remained at hartfield after all the rest , his thoughts full of what he had seen ; so full , that when the candles came to assist his observations , he must -- yes , he certainly must , as a friend -- an anxious friend -- give emma some hint , ask her some question .  <eos>   this was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the great house at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages , mr musgrove ' s coach containing the four ladies , and charles ' s curricle , in which he drove captain wentworth , were descending the long hill into lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone .  <eos>   he caught the word ; it seemed to rouse him at once , and saying only -- " true , true , a surgeon this instant ," was darting away , when anne eagerly suggested --  <eos>   but just got acquainted with mrs . weston , and others !-- i hate the recollection ."  <eos>   till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it .  <eos>   you will soon , i earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself .-- no description can describe her .  <eos>   a glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate .  <eos>   his situation is an evil -- but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend ; and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more .  <eos>   " quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day ' s party , which it might very possibly have done , for mr . woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence .  <eos>   emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love .  <eos>   captain wentworth ' s eyes were also turned towards her .  <eos>   " you mistake me , you quite mistake me ," she replied , exerting herself .  <eos>   " emma knows i never flatter her ," said mr . knightley , " but i meant no reflection on any body .  <eos>   i have a great regard for you and emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence !-- at any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two ."  <eos>   " and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   the charming augusta hawkins , in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands as would always be called ten ; a point of some dignity , as well as some convenience : the story told well ; he had not thrown himself away -- he had gained a woman of , l . or thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity -- the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice ; the history which he had to give mrs . cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps so quick , from the accidental rencontre , to the dinner at mr . green ' s , and the party at mrs . brown ' s -- smiles and blushes rising in importance -- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- had in short , to use a most intelligible phrase , been so very ready to have him , that vanity and prudence were equally contented .  <eos>   but is not this a sudden scheme ?"  <eos>   however , i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again .  <eos>   anne was now at hand to take up her own cause , and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him , where conviction was at least very agreeable , he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone , though he still wanted her to join them in the evening , when the child might be at rest for the night , and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her , but she was quite unpersuadable ; and this being the case , she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits .  <eos>   knightley ."  <eos>   " my poor dear harriet !  <eos>   but mary did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an elliot , or from not wanting to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed .  <eos>   how unworthily occupied !  <eos>   it seemed as if mr shepherd , in this anxiety to bespeak sir walter ' s good will towards a naval officer as tenant , had been gifted with foresight ; for the very first application for the house was from an admiral croft , with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton ; and indeed , he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent .  <eos>   " there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage , but it ended in nothing ; and i have not heard him mentioned lately ."  <eos>   it was a very extraordinary thing !  <eos>   what !-- engaged to her all the winter -- before either of them came to highbury ?"  <eos>   he paused .  <eos>   " well , sir ," cried mr . weston , " as i took miss taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if i can ; and i will step to mrs . goddard in a moment , if you wish it ."  <eos>   the post - office has a great charm at one period of our lives .  <eos>   hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to .  <eos>   its character as a ball - room caught him ; and instead of passing on , he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased .  <eos>   she replied with a smile of astonishment , " are you imagining me to be mr . elton ' s object ?"  <eos>   however , i do really think mr . martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but as to leaving you , it is what i would not do upon any consideration ."  <eos>   in a few minutes the carriage returned .-- somebody talked of rain .-- " i will see that there are umbrellas , sir ," said frank to his father : " miss bates must not be forgotten :" and away he went .  <eos>   it is not a connexion to gratify ; but if mr . churchill does not feel that , why should we ?  <eos>   this invitation of mary ' s removed all lady russell ' s difficulties , and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath till lady russell took her , and that all the intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge .  <eos>   " no , indeed i do not ."  <eos>   there was no superiority of manner , accomplishment , or understanding .  <eos>   " i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child .  <eos>   she is dead !"  <eos>   " take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself ."  <eos>   " very like maple grove indeed !-- she was quite struck by the likeness !-- that room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at maple grove ; her sister ' s favourite room ."  <eos>   he should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet mr . and mrs . elton , and any other of his neighbours .-- he could not see any objection at all to his , and emma ' s , and harriet ' s going there some very fine morning .  <eos>   chuse your own degree of crossness .  <eos>   she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters , and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed -- very sad for herself and her children .  <eos>   in speaking of the harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of mrs harville ' s exertions as a nurse .  <eos>   she was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that mrs . weston foretold .  <eos>   they would hardly come in their chaise , i think , at that season of the year .  <eos>   and we agreed it would be best to have the harp , for it seems to amuse her more than the piano - forte .  <eos>   i was told that they wished it .  <eos>   they had not been long seated and composed when mr . woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter ' s attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last .  <eos>   anne had a moment ' s astonishment on the subject herself ; but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville , to turn the actual space to the best account , to supply the deficiencies of lodging - house furniture , and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected .  <eos>   your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her .-- she will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman ' s language can make interesting .-- in our communications we deal only in the great .-- however , i must say , that robert martin ' s heart seemed for _him_ , and to _me_ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at astley ' s , my brother took charge of mrs . john knightley and little john , and he followed with miss smith and henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make miss smith rather uneasy ."  <eos>   " i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves ."  <eos>   miss carteret , with still less to say , was so plain and so awkward , that she would never have been tolerated in camden place but for her birth .  <eos>   he was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about jane ' s age : and jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .  <eos>   he had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied .  <eos>   and yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will .  <eos>   i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it ."  <eos>   " no , indeed , i shall grant you nothing .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   they must encounter each other , and make the best of it .  <eos>   i was once very near -- and i wish i had -- it would have been better .  <eos>   they must be separated ; but there was a great deal of pain in the process -- so much to herself at this time , that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation , and resolved on going home by way of randalls to procure it .  <eos>   " yes -- rather -- i have been thinking of it some little time ."  <eos>   he told her the news .  <eos>   " not at all ."  <eos>   let me entreat you to run no risks .  <eos>   perry tells me that mr . cole never touches malt liquor .  <eos>   poverty certainly has not contracted her mind : i really believe , if she had only a shilling in the world , she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it ; and nobody is afraid of her : that is a great charm ."  <eos>   " between mr . frank churchill and miss fairfax ?  <eos>   " i suspect ," said sir walter coolly , " that admiral croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall .  <eos>   but i gave what i believed the general opinion , when i called him plain ."  <eos>   he had gone away rejected and mortified -- disappointed in a very sanguine hope , after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement ; and not only losing the right lady , but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one .  <eos>   she was extremely angry with herself .  <eos>   how fast i made money in her .  <eos>   the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably .  <eos>   they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister .  <eos>   i shall not attempt calling on mrs . goddard , for i really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing .  <eos>   " yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off .  <eos>   an old married man -- quite good for nothing .  <eos>   if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open !-- good - bye , good - bye ."  <eos>   this was too true for contradiction .  <eos>   well , that must be infinitely provoking !  <eos>   for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am , and as i am ."  <eos>   i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person ."  <eos>   _what_ she was , must be uncertain ; but _who_ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the , l ., it did not appear that she was at all harriet ' s superior .  <eos>   he came back gay and self - satisfied , eager and busy , caring nothing for miss woodhouse , and defying miss smith .  <eos>   they were combined only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep concern .  <eos>   " you have heard of a certain frank churchill , i presume ," he continued -- " and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name ."  <eos>   thirteen winters ' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded , and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms , as she travelled up to london with her father , for a few weeks ' annual enjoyment of the great world .  <eos>   now , an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter .  <eos>   i am sorry for it .  <eos>   " our poor ball must be quite given up ."  <eos>   now , my dear madam , i will release you ; but i could not conclude before .  <eos>   " indeed , i am very sorry to be right in this instance .  <eos>   exactly so indeed !"  <eos>   the beginning , however , of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings , and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality .  <eos>   you would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury ."  <eos>   " my father and mrs . weston are at the crown at this moment ," said frank churchill , " examining the capabilities of the house .  <eos>   " i do not offer it for miss smith ' s collection ," said he .  <eos>   of south park , in the county of gloucester , by which lady ( who died ) he has issue elizabeth , born june , ; anne , born august , ; a still - born son , november , ; mary , born november , ."  <eos>   it was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harriet ' s coming to hartfield .  <eos>   mr . martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at mr . weston ' s time of life ?"  <eos>   " there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage , but it ended in nothing ; and i have not heard him mentioned lately ."  <eos>   picture to yourselves my amazement ; i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin .  <eos>   she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered -- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up .-- the house was larger than hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms .-- it was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding .-- some faults of temper john knightley had ; but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably .  <eos>   she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke , and opening the casement there , immediately called mr . knightley ' s attention , and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others , as if it had passed within the same apartment .  <eos>   " if i did not know her to be happy now ," said emma , seriously , " which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , i could not bear these thanks ;-- for , oh !  <eos>   the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself .  <eos>   but i could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well .  <eos>   in another moment a happier sight caught her ;-- mr . knightley leading harriet to the set !-- never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant .  <eos>   " you seem determined to think ill of him ."  <eos>   the ladies knew better how to allay it .  <eos>   the longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency .  <eos>   and a .-- em - ma .-- do you understand ?"  <eos>   it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight .  <eos>   he was not in his best spirits , but seemed trying to improve them ; and , at last , made himself talk nonsense very agreeably .  <eos>   to the great house accordingly they went , to sit the full half hour in the old - fashioned square parlour , with a small carpet and shining floor , to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano - forte and a harp , flower - stands and little tables placed in every direction .  <eos>   she had no objection .  <eos>   a bed on the floor in louisa ' s room would be sufficient for her , if mrs harville would but think so ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " good heaven !"  <eos>   " indeed i will .  <eos>   we do not call bermuda or bahama , you know , the west indies ."  <eos>   the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this mr musgrove , for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning .  <eos>   exclaimed mr . knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , " no , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation .  <eos>   still , however , he was not happy .  <eos>   it was almost enough to make her think of marrying .  <eos>   happy those , who can remain at highbury !"  <eos>   " pray say no more .  <eos>   i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday , but the case is very different to - day ."  <eos>   this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come .  <eos>   they will soon be in yorkshire .  <eos>   " they are blended ," said he , " i acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good .  <eos>   she had a strong impression of his having said , in a vext tone of voice , after captain wentworth ' s interference , " you ought to have minded me , walter ; i told you not to teaze your aunt ;" and could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself .  <eos>   the dream must be borne with , and mr . knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield , and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use , instead of the small - sized pembroke , on which two of his daily meals had , for forty years been crowded .  <eos>   the character of mrs . churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed .  <eos>   did you ever hear of that ?-- a water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard .  <eos>   they want her ( mr . and mrs . dixon ) excessively to come over with colonel and mrs . campbell ; quite depend upon it ; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation , jane says , as you will hear presently ; mr . dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention .  <eos>   said he , ` i can fasten the rivet .  <eos>   these were pleasant feelings , and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did , and collect round the strawberry - beds .-- the whole party were assembled , excepting frank churchill , who was expected every moment from richmond ; and mrs . elton , in all her apparatus of happiness , her large bonnet and her basket , was very ready to lead the way in gathering , accepting , or talking -- strawberries , and only strawberries , could now be thought or spoken of .--" the best fruit in england -- every body ' s favourite -- always wholesome .-- these the finest beds and finest sorts .-- delightful to gather for one ' s self -- the only way of really enjoying them .-- morning decidedly the best time -- never tired -- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison -- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce -- chili preferred -- white wood finest flavour of all -- price of strawberries in london -- abundance about bristol -- maple grove -- cultivation -- beds when to be renewed -- gardeners thinking exactly different -- no general rule -- gardeners never to be put out of their way -- delicious fruit -- only too rich to be eaten much of -- inferior to cherries -- currants more refreshing -- only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping -- glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer -- must go and sit in the shade ."  <eos>   her voice was not unsteady ; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self , such a burst of threatening evil , such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions , must create .-- she listened with much inward suffering , but with great outward patience , to harriet ' s detail .-- methodical , or well arranged , or very well delivered , it could not be expected to be ; but it contained , when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration , a substance to sink her spirit -- especially with the corroborating circumstances , which her own memory brought in favour of mr . knightley ' s most improved opinion of harriet .  <eos>   colonel campbell rather preferred an olive .  <eos>   early , i know , you had none ."  <eos>   such a very kind attention -- and so thoughtful an attention !-- the sort of thing that so few men would think of .  <eos>   if he were , every thing else must give way ; but otherwise his friend cole had been saying so much about his dining with him -- had made such a point of it , that he had promised him conditionally to come .  <eos>   and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister , who was _very_ _well_ _married_ , to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_ , near bristol , who kept two carriages !  <eos>   and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed i believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again -- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable .  <eos>   interference -- fruitless interference .  <eos>   he caught the word ; it seemed to rouse him at once , and saying only -- " true , true , a surgeon this instant ," was darting away , when anne eagerly suggested --  <eos>   i know what you mean -- but emma ' s hand is the strongest ."  <eos>   she was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness , among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past , which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it .  <eos>   mrs . dixon , i understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with miss fairfax ."  <eos>   pray do not make any more matches ."  <eos>   the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself .  <eos>   " oh no ; as to leaving the little boy ," both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought ; and anne , in the joy of the escape , could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs .  <eos>   the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of harriet ' s welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security .-- what had she to wish for ?  <eos>   mr . suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove , and whose father had it before him -- i believe , at least -- i am almost sure that old mr . suckling had completed the purchase before his death ."  <eos>   " what an excellent device ," said he , " the use of a sheepskin for carriages .  <eos>   who can think of miss smith , when miss woodhouse is near !  <eos>   and , pray , who is charles hayter ?  <eos>   i would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_ , is a mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value ."  <eos>   if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it ;-- and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can ;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man ' s house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow .  <eos>   " he has been here this very morning , on a most extraordinary errand .  <eos>   you will excuse me .  <eos>   what a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave !-- he gave his consent with very little persuasion ."  <eos>   i cannot really change for the better .  <eos>   we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a something more early implanted .  <eos>   two dances , unfortunately , were all that could be allowed .  <eos>   yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so .  <eos>   it was the same , the very same man , with no difference but of dress .  <eos>   " i cannot think there is any danger of it ," was emma ' s calm answer -- " and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax ' s situation and understand what her home has been , with colonel and mrs . campbell , i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown ."  <eos>   such confidence , powerful in its own warmth , and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it , must have been enough for anne ; but lady russell saw it very differently .  <eos>   mrs . weston was sorry for such a charge .  <eos>   captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part , and to be soon followed by the two ladies .  <eos>   we copied it from the elegant extracts .  <eos>   a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction , as the most graceful set of limbs in the world .  <eos>   yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them .  <eos>   without his sanction i could not hope to be listened to again .-- i spoke ; circumstances were in my favour ; the late event had softened away his pride , and he was , earlier than i could have anticipated , wholly reconciled and complying ; and could say at last , poor man !  <eos>   warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still .  <eos>   poor fellow !-- sad business for him .-- she was extremely concerned ; for , though very eccentric , he had a thousand good qualities .-- how could he be so taken in ?-- did not think him at all in love -- not in the least .-- poor knightley !-- there would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him .-- how happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him !  <eos>   elton had just joined them , and his wife was exclaiming ,  <eos>   there was a seriousness in harriet ' s manner which prepared her , quite as much as her words , for something more than ordinary .  <eos>   mrs . john knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a mr . wingfield , she was quite eager to have harriet under her care .-- when it was thus settled on her sister ' s side , emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable .-- harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in mr . woodhouse ' s carriage .-- it was all arranged , it was all completed , and harriet was safe in brunswick square .  <eos>   but consider -- you need not be afraid of delegating power to _me_ .  <eos>   let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations .  <eos>   he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips .  <eos>   i know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit .  <eos>   " well , i cannot understand it ."  <eos>   my mother does not hear ; she is a little deaf you know .  <eos>   come , sir , pray let me hear it ."  <eos>   said mrs musgrove to mrs croft .  <eos>   " how odd you are !  <eos>   her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married .  <eos>   the change on mrs . elton ' s side soon afterwards appeared , and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of mrs . elton , nor , under mrs . elton ' s guidance , the very active patroness of jane fairfax , and only sharing with others in a general way , in knowing what was felt , what was meditated , what was done .  <eos>   happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it .-- though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged , he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any ; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons ' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them .  <eos>   sir frederick and lady wentworth !  <eos>   papa , if you speak in that melancholy way , you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all .  <eos>   poor old mrs . bates , civil and humble as usual , looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   i wonder what will become of her !"  <eos>   he could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap .  <eos>   her spirits seemed overcome .  <eos>   they separated too much into parties .  <eos>   i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning ."  <eos>   no doubt he is a sensible man , and i suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words .  <eos>   there were mr . and mrs . weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect .  <eos>   replied he .  <eos>   " i hope ," said he presently , " i have not been severe upon poor mrs . churchill .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   " my dear , you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself --"  <eos>   is perry going to set up his carriage , frank ?  <eos>   it only added a dangerous character to himself .  <eos>   " i do so wonder , miss woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married !  <eos>   she believed he had been drinking too much of mr . weston ' s good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense .  <eos>   " but then , to be an old maid at last , like miss bates !"  <eos>   she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy .  <eos>   nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth : but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal , that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand ; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her .  <eos>   i like him very much .  <eos>   the carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage ;-- one morning , i remember , he came to me quite in despair ."  <eos>   the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , i think is best observed by meals within doors .  <eos>   rub her hands , rub her temples ; here are salts ; take them , take them ."  <eos>   they walked together .  <eos>   his good friend perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter .  <eos>   they were a couple worth looking at .  <eos>   the varieties in the fitting - up of the rooms , where the common necessaries provided by the owner , in the common indifferent plight , were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood , excellently worked up , and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries captain harville had visited , were more than amusing to anne ; connected as it all was with his profession , the fruit of its labours , the effect of its influence on his habits , the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented , made it to her a something more , or less , than gratification .  <eos>   it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea ; a very great object , i wanted to be doing something ."  <eos>   adopt her , educate her ."  <eos>   " we must be decided , and without the loss of another minute .  <eos>   your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage .  <eos>   in general , his voice and manner were studiously calm .  <eos>   the persons to be invited , required little thought .  <eos>   but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for .  <eos>   however , we may as well go and sit with them a little while , and when we have that over , we can enjoy our walk ."  <eos>   she exerted herself , and did try to make her comfortable , by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle , and quite unworthy of being dwelt on ,  <eos>   colonel wallis said it , and lady russell saw it ; but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind , nor ( she began pretty soon to suspect ) to prevent his thinking of a second choice .  <eos>   he lived about a mile from highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london .  <eos>   for her own sake she could not be rude ; and for harriet ' s , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of mr . elton ' s nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to .  <eos>   miss bates , let emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart -- a _very_ little bit .  <eos>   emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned .  <eos>   she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with , and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever , which , finally settling in her legs , had made her for the present a cripple .  <eos>   chapter vii  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   she had been forced into prudence in her youth , she learned romance as she grew older : the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning .  <eos>   " did you go then ?  <eos>   it is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs ."  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   mrs . weston , did you ever hear the like ?  <eos>   mr . elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage .  <eos>   what do you think of him ?  <eos>   emma could not have a better companion than harriet ."  <eos>   emma did not want to be classed with the mrs . eltons , the mrs . perrys , and the mrs . coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself -- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned miss bates farther as to her niece ' s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist .  <eos>   i always deserve the best treatment , because i never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer .  <eos>   " oh no !  <eos>   the toils of the business were over , the sweets began .  <eos>   " not the least in the world .-- did he ever give you any thing ?"  <eos>   " i do not know ; but i can hardly suppose that , at admiral croft ' s time of life , and in his profession , he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this ."  <eos>   she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her , hereafter , with either of isabella ' s sons ; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best .  <eos>   captain harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before , and captain wentworth ' s anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to lyme .  <eos>   there are several odd - looking men walking about here , who , i am told , are sailors .  <eos>   you may think , miss elliot , whether he is dear to us !"  <eos>   she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire -- the extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and that even when days were fixed , and invitations accepted , it was an even chance that mrs . churchill were not in health and spirits for going ; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person ; and that , though he had his separate engagements , it was not without difficulty , without considerable address _at_ _times_ , that he could get away , or introduce an acquaintance for a night .  <eos>   she would not take a denial .  <eos>   it would be a _secret_ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate .  <eos>   she was the instigator .  <eos>   " so early in life -- at three - and - twenty -- a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill . at three - and - twenty to have drawn such a prize !  <eos>   let me entreat you to run no risks .  <eos>   she is a shrewd , intelligent , sensible woman .  <eos>   henrietta fully thought so herself , before captain wentworth came ; but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten .  <eos>   " i see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention .  <eos>   what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding - cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body ' s eating it .  <eos>   " yes , simpleton as i was !-- but i am quite ashamed of it now , and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them .  <eos>   weston ?-- to bath , or to clifton ?"  <eos>   the consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been -- that had been -- hard for him to bear .  <eos>   see the consequence of keeping you company !-- what do you say to it ?"  <eos>   it had been weakness and timidity .  <eos>   the two families had always been on excellent terms , there being no pride on one side , and no envy on the other , and only such a consciousness of superiority in the miss musgroves , as made them pleased to improve their cousins .  <eos>   have you finished it ?  <eos>   mrs . weston was disengaged and emma began again --" mr . frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman ' s hands i ever saw ."  <eos>   i know mr . john knightley too well -- i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body .  <eos>   he was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said ,  <eos>   said emma , as she turned back into the hall again .  <eos>   but it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment ' s uneasiness can ever occur between us again .  <eos>   chapter x  <eos>   while she talked of his son , mr . weston ' s attention was chained ; but when she got to maple grove , he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to , and with happy smiles must hurry away .  <eos>   mrs musgrove had got mrs harville ' s children away as much as she could , every possible supply from uppercross had been furnished , to lighten the inconvenience to the harvilles , while the harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day ; and in short , it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable .  <eos>   "-- mrs . weston , i suppose ," interrupted mrs . elton , rather mortified .  <eos>   he proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , i was convinced he could not do better .  <eos>   what anne first heard was --  <eos>   i like her the better for it .  <eos>   " indeed !  <eos>   besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach .  <eos>   many had looked on each other , and many had repeated the name , before all this had been got through , even by the smart rapidity of a waiter .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   " if i had set my heart on mr . elton ' s marrying harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself .  <eos>   " harriet , i will only venture to declare , that mr . knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does ."  <eos>   " me !-- oh !  <eos>   all that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators .  <eos>   the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch , and which she had felt slighted , and been compelled to smother among the musgroves , were now become but of secondary interest .  <eos>   you had it from himself , had you ?"  <eos>   hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to .  <eos>   " miss woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- i have something that i should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over ."  <eos>   he had always been lucky ; he knew he should be so still .  <eos>   he appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   better be without sense , than misapply it as you do ."  <eos>   emma could not forgive her .  <eos>   they had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before , and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence .  <eos>   elton ?-- that will be a favour indeed !  <eos>   were i to fall in love , indeed , it would be a different thing !  <eos>   we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all .  <eos>   the ball proceeded pleasantly .  <eos>   mrs . elton had most kindly sent jane a note , or we should have been .-- but two such offers in one day !-- never were such neighbours .  <eos>   perhaps to hartfield , perhaps to the abbey mill , perhaps into his woods .-- miss woodhouse , this is not like our friend knightley !-- can you explain it ?"  <eos>   that was the act of a very , very young man , one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure .  <eos>   " i hope ," said he presently , " i have not been severe upon poor mrs . churchill .  <eos>   and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love ."  <eos>   said he , offering his hand .  <eos>   miss hamilton , now mrs smith , had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable .  <eos>   " and make her like myself ."  <eos>   she tried to dissuade mary from going , but in vain ; and that being the case , thought it best to accept the miss musgroves ' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise , as she might be useful in turning back with her sister , and lessening the interference in any plan of their own .  <eos>   it was a palpable display , repeated on every possible occasion .  <eos>   one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry .  <eos>   captain weston , who had been considered , especially by the churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .  <eos>   they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered their expectations in every respect .  <eos>   turning away distressed .  <eos>   one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other ."  <eos>   i have observed , mrs . elton , in the course of my life , that if things are going untowardly one month , they are sure to mend the next ."  <eos>   i feel that all the apologies should be on my side .  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   his ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer .  <eos>   -- bad enough as it is , for i absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree .-- i believe i have not played a bar this fortnight .-- however , he is coming , i assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all ."  <eos>   my perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before ."  <eos>   she was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature ."  <eos>   once , too , he spoke to her .  <eos>   she saw that there had been bad habits ; that sunday travelling had been a common thing ; that there had been a period of his life ( and probably not a short one ) when he had been , at least , careless in all serious matters ; and , though he might now think very differently , who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever , cautious man , grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ?  <eos>   he seems perfectly unprepared for that ."  <eos>   it was a fine family - piece .  <eos>   she was good enough for mr . elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for highbury -- handsome enough -- to look plain , probably , by harriet ' s side .  <eos>   i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which i was not at all pleased with .  <eos>   emma ' s sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between mr . knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation .  <eos>   and , besides , i must give you a hint , frank ; any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided .  <eos>   anne saw them wherever she went .  <eos>   woodhouse ?-- i am so glad to hear such a good account .  <eos>   woodhouse ?-- i am so glad to hear such a good account .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   the ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner .  <eos>   william did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for william , you know , thinks more of his master ' s profit than any thing ; but mrs . hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away .  <eos>   this was colonel campbell , who had very highly regarded fairfax , as an excellent officer and most deserving young man ; and farther , had been indebted to him for such attentions , during a severe camp - fever , as he believed had saved his life .  <eos>   he seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her .  <eos>   then , forgetting to think of it , she was at the other end of the room , beautifying a nosegay ; then , she ate her cold meat ; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk .  <eos>   i think you understand me , therefore ."  <eos>   _he_ had done it .  <eos>   " emma , my love , you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy ; but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected .  <eos>   i shall see you at the abbey to - morrow morning i hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion ."  <eos>   walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good ;" and , in short , her look and manner declared , that go she would not .  <eos>   such an adventure as this ,-- a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way , could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain .  <eos>   i cannot pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine -- i overheard him telling henrietta all about it ; and then ` miss elliot ' was spoken of in the highest terms !  <eos>   " you are mistaken ," said he gently , " that is not good company ; that is the best .  <eos>   i did not know that i had fixed a day , but as he says i did , i am going now ."  <eos>   emma laughed and disclaimed .  <eos>   and the bell was rung , and the carriages spoken for .  <eos>   you know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us .  <eos>   i certainly get better and better .-- now for it ."  <eos>   " how much i am obliged to you ," said he , " for telling me to come to - day !-- if it had not been for you , i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party .  <eos>   i will call another day , and hear the pianoforte ."  <eos>   " mr . martin , i suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ?  <eos>   the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest .  <eos>   it is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other ."  <eos>   though it was rather desirable that mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay ; yet the time required by the uppercross horses to take them back , would be a dreadful extension of suspense ; and captain wentworth proposed , and charles musgrove agreed , that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn , and leave mr musgrove ' s carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early , when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of louisa ' s night .  <eos>   he had still a small house in highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away .  <eos>   " there are few among the gentlemen of the navy , i imagine , who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description ."  <eos>   " i do so wonder , miss woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married !  <eos>   william larkins is such an old acquaintance !  <eos>   depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing _you_ justice .  <eos>   -- three girls , the two eldest sixteen and fourteen , was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath , an awful charge rather , to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited , silly father .  <eos>   and it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting .  <eos>   " i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , miss woodhouse ," she shortly afterwards began , " since the party to box hill .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused .  <eos>   " no ,"-- replied emma -- quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke --" i should like to take another turn .  <eos>   i have done with match - making indeed .  <eos>   said she , beginning again when they were all in the street .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   " how you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me !-- they _will_ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them !"  <eos>   one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance .  <eos>   but to be sure , in general they are so spoilt !  <eos>   her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected .  <eos>   but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand .  <eos>   she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .  <eos>   said he with a tender sigh , as he received it .  <eos>   this is a connexion which offers nothing but good .  <eos>   you think so , do not you ?"  <eos>   he looked at her , as if wanting to read her thoughts .  <eos>   i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other .  <eos>   miss woodhouse , i am quite concerned , i am sure you hit your foot .  <eos>   i wonder whereabouts they will upset to - day .  <eos>   at the same time , nobody could wonder if mr . elton should have aspired -- miss woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly .  <eos>   mr . cole said how much taste you had ; and mr . frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution ."  <eos>   had you not been surrounded by other friends , i might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct .-- i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent ."  <eos>   " you spent the evening with mrs .  <eos>   better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again .  <eos>   behold him there , the monarch of the seas !  <eos>   my uncle has been too good for me to encroach .-- i must still add to this long letter .  <eos>   anne will stay ; anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him .  <eos>   my dear isabella , i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr . perry yet ; and he never forgets you ."  <eos>   -- she could really say nothing .--" you are silent ," he cried , with great animation ; " absolutely silent !  <eos>   mr . elton was only too happy .  <eos>   miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry him ."  <eos>   " yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and colonel and mrs . campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately ."  <eos>   quite delightful to have you all meet so !-- our little room so honoured !"  <eos>   that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents .  <eos>   seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs . elton and jane fairfax were talking of .-- a situation , a most desirable situation , was in question .  <eos>   do put up your horse at the crown , and come in ."  <eos>   said i , ` i shall not forestall jane ; i left her dancing with mr . george otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was mr . elton , i do not know who will ask her next , perhaps mr . william cox .'  <eos>   she gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child ' s pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them .  <eos>   " i think , indeed ," said john knightley pleasantly , " that mr . weston has some little claim .  <eos>   every moment had brought a fresh surprize ; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her .-- how to understand it all !  <eos>   but i kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as i dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment ."  <eos>   they were infinitely worse .  <eos>   i want a change .  <eos>   i never shall forget his manner .  <eos>   it was to be a whole - length in water - colours , like mr . john knightley ' s , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece .  <eos>   elton !-- the stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed .  <eos>   they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together .  <eos>   it had not been possible for him to spend less ; he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot was imperiously called on to do ; but blameless as he was , he was not only growing dreadfully in debt , but was hearing of it so often , that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer , even partially , from his daughter .  <eos>   chapter viii  <eos>   i should not have used the expression .  <eos>   she was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness , among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past , which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it .  <eos>   this is a matter of mere common politeness and good - breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry ."  <eos>   but , perhaps -- i may be equally in the way here .  <eos>   the hardness of the pavement for her feet , made him less willing upon the present occasion ; he did it , however .  <eos>   " but , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer .  <eos>   emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with harriet smith ; but it was too tender a subject .-- she could not enter on it .-- harriet was very seldom mentioned between them .  <eos>   now , i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea .  <eos>   " charles may say what he pleases ," cried mary to anne , as soon as he was out of the room , " but it would be shocking to have henrietta marry charles hayter ; a very bad thing for her , and still worse for me ; and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head , and i have very little doubt that he has .  <eos>   for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself .  <eos>   the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this mr musgrove , for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning .  <eos>   " nor , if you were , could i ever bear to part with you , my harriet .  <eos>   little emma , grow up a better woman than your aunt .  <eos>   anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility , and she must acknowledge herself disappointed .  <eos>   mr . and mrs . elton appeared ; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed .  <eos>   mr . weston was a native of highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property .  <eos>   when people come in this manner on purpose to ask us , how can one say no ?"  <eos>   but harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself .  <eos>   and frank churchill was heard to say , " i think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling .  <eos>   alas !  <eos>   the difference which randalls , randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great ."  <eos>   mr . and mrs . john knightley , from having been longer than usual absent from surry , were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest .  <eos>   i like a job of that sort excessively .'  <eos>   mr . elton ' s superiority had very ample acknowledgment .  <eos>   her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman ."  <eos>   she would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _alone_ , and that you know --( nodding towards her father )-- humph !-- can you come ?"  <eos>   i hope you turned directly ."  <eos>   that is , i _presume_ it to be so on her side , and i can _answer_ for its being so on his .  <eos>   he called her ` augusta .'  <eos>   harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly .  <eos>   she deprecated the connexion in every light .  <eos>   cried emma , " this has been a most unfortunate -- most deplorable mistake !-- what is to be done ?"  <eos>   anne , must not it be our mr elliot ?  <eos>   his ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer .  <eos>   " oh , dear ," cried harriet , " now i recollect what you mean ; but i was thinking of something very different at the time .  <eos>   " i have not said , exert yourself harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of mr . elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , i would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity .  <eos>   " it was you , and not your sister , i find , that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with , when he was in this country ."  <eos>   said she , when they were ready .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   nursing does not belong to a man ; it is not his province .  <eos>   " i have very little to say for my own conduct .-- i was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased .-- an old story , probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding .  <eos>   you appear to me a little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to - morrow will bring , i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to - night ."  <eos>   mrs . dixon , i understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with miss fairfax ."  <eos>   i wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady .  <eos>   this made a difficulty .  <eos>   we must do whatever is to be done quickest , and i think our feelings will lose no time there .  <eos>   his genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path .  <eos>   as it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else .  <eos>   i will answer for the gentleman ' s indifference ."  <eos>   with respect to her father , it was a question soon answered .  <eos>   escape , however , was not his plan .  <eos>   that is a great thing .  <eos>   i would not have mr . knightley know any thing about it for the world !  <eos>   bless me !  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " i am very much obliged to you ," said emma , laughing again .  <eos>   such delightful proofs of hartfield ' s attraction , as those sort of visits conveyed , might shortly be over .  <eos>   she had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else ; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double - dyed , and therefore only said in reply ,  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   " here comes this dear old beau of mine , i protest !-- only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men !-- what a dear creature he is ;-- i assure you i like him excessively .  <eos>   she had often observed the change , to almost the same extent .-- harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him -- and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet .  <eos>   in one moment such a change !  <eos>   fetch miss bates .  <eos>   she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority , but she could not doubt his being rich ; and , in favour of his constancy , she had no reason to believe him married .  <eos>   sir walter would quit kellynch hall ; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision , the great question of whither he should go was settled , and the first outline of this important change made out .  <eos>   emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love .  <eos>   " she will think frank ought to ask her ."  <eos>   go to - day , go to - day .  <eos>   she was so surprized she did not know what to do .  <eos>   should she proceed no farther ?-- should she let it pass , and seem to suspect nothing ?-- perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances , she was perfectly resolved .-- she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once , all that she meant to say and know .  <eos>   " yes , sometimes he can ."  <eos>   anne was ashamed .  <eos>   " so much the better -- or so much the worse :-- i do not know which .  <eos>   and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind .  <eos>   -- she could really say nothing .--" you are silent ," he cried , with great animation ; " absolutely silent !  <eos>   and mr . weston tried , in vain , to make them harmonise better .  <eos>   she asked no more questions therefore , merely employed her own fancy , and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern -- something just come to light , of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family ,-- something which the late event at richmond had brought forward .  <eos>   he is in highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston .  <eos>   they were so deserving , that a _little_ higher should have been enough : but as it was , how could she have done otherwise ?-- impossible !-- she could not repent .  <eos>   she drew up plans of economy , she made exact calculations , and she did what nobody else thought of doing : she consulted anne , who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question .  <eos>   the business was finished , and harriet safe .  <eos>   dear , no ," said her companion .  <eos>   emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the crown .  <eos>   there was no comfort in having him in london ; he might as well be at enscombe ; but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse .  <eos>   like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her .  <eos>   a better written letter , harriet ( returning it ,) than i had expected ."  <eos>   " i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr . elton .  <eos>   " you mean mr wentworth , i suppose ?"  <eos>   " what is the matter ?"  <eos>   " have you any idea of mr . knightley ' s returning your affection ?"  <eos>   this was one of her expressions .  <eos>   i was sixteen years old when you were born ."  <eos>   when shall i leave you again ?"  <eos>   how the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep !  <eos>   walk home !-- you are prettily shod for walking home , i dare say .  <eos>   " i honour his sincerity .  <eos>   emma ' s project of forgetting mr . elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her .  <eos>   chapter xviii  <eos>   he was very much pleased with randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to highbury , highbury itself , hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one ' s _own_ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it .  <eos>   " i have let my house to admiral croft ," would sound extremely well ; very much better than to any mere mr --; a mr ( save , perhaps , some half dozen in the nation ,) always needs a note of explanation .  <eos>   elton ?"  <eos>   she was sure that he had not been happy in marriage .  <eos>   i knew she would .  <eos>   my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days .  <eos>   an abominable puppy !-- you know who i mean ( nodding to her husband ).  <eos>   their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross ; and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place , which had been taken , and her regret that mrs clay should still be with them , anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick , than her own father ' s house in camden place , or her own sister ' s intimacy with mrs clay .  <eos>   mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him ."  <eos>   mr . weston , however , too eager to be very observant , too communicative to want others to talk , was very well satisfied with what she did say , and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already .  <eos>   there she sat -- and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding ?  <eos>   i admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   frank churchill had danced once at highbury , and longed to dance again ; and the last half - hour of an evening which mr . woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls , was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject .  <eos>   it is the greatest amusement in the world !  <eos>   emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife .  <eos>   " if you are very kind ," said he , " it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night ;-- let me live them over again .  <eos>   " i wish we could contrive it ," said she ; " but i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in ;-- no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father ."  <eos>   selina is no fine lady , i assure you .  <eos>   " indeed you did .  <eos>   the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other .  <eos>   in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her .  <eos>   it is always the lady ' s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance .  <eos>   anne and henrietta , finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning , agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast .  <eos>   it reminded her of their first forlorn tete - a - tete , on the evening of mrs . weston ' s wedding - day ; but mr . knightley had walked in then , soon after tea , and dissipated every melancholy fancy .  <eos>   with the exception , perhaps , of admiral and mrs croft , who seemed particularly attached and happy , ( anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples ), there could have been no two hearts so open , no tastes so similar , no feelings so in unison , no countenances so beloved .  <eos>   " what does all that signify ?  <eos>   " very true ," said harriet .  <eos>   if he means any thing , it must be to please you .  <eos>   i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs . goddard .  <eos>   she considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure , and saw no dignity in anything short of it .  <eos>   she exerted herself , and did try to make her comfortable , by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle , and quite unworthy of being dwelt on ,  <eos>   " i do not know .-- one of the otways .-- not frank ;-- it is not frank , i assure you .  <eos>   i remember saying to myself , ` even emma , with all her partiality for harriet , will think this a good match .'"  <eos>   the list she drew up when only fourteen -- i remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that i preserved it some time ; and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now .  <eos>   no ; cautious as a minister of state .  <eos>   she paused over it , while harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a " well , well ," and was at last forced to add , " is it a good letter ?  <eos>   she was quite convinced of mr . elton ' s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   you have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper ."  <eos>   captain wentworth had no fortune .  <eos>   here it comes .  <eos>   there was a numerous family ; but the only two grown up , excepting charles , were henrietta and louisa , young ladies of nineteen and twenty , who had brought from school at exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments , and were now like thousands of other young ladies , living to be fashionable , happy , and merry .  <eos>   " that may be -- but not by sketches in swisserland .  <eos>   and you can be always with me .  <eos>   " you mean to return a favourable answer , i collect ."  <eos>   dear , miss woodhouse -- well , at last , i fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another .  <eos>   i will send you some more , before they get good for nothing .'  <eos>   i have crossed the atlantic four times , and have been once to the east indies , and back again , and only once ; besides being in different places about home : cork , and lisbon , and gibraltar .  <eos>   chapter vi  <eos>   -- repeated mr .  <eos>   she would have been too happy but for poor harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from hartfield .  <eos>   ` my dear ,' said i , ` i shall say you are laid down upon the bed :' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room .  <eos>   the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from mr . elton to mr . woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with mr . elton ' s best compliments , " that he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of mr . woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense -- and had mr . woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them ."  <eos>   " the last time i saw her she had a red nose , but i hope that may not happen every day ."  <eos>   " time , my dearest emma , time will heal the wound .-- your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your father ' s sake -- i know you will not allow yourself --."  <eos>   " we think so very differently on this point , mr . knightley , that there can be no use in canvassing it .  <eos>   absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude .  <eos>   -- bad enough as it is , for i absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree .-- i believe i have not played a bar this fortnight .-- however , he is coming , i assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all ."  <eos>   if it were war now , he would have settled it long ago .  <eos>   and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ` oh !'  <eos>   soup too !  <eos>   poor mr . woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again .  <eos>   it was not merely complaisance , it must be a liking to the cause , which made him enter warmly into her father and sister ' s solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them .  <eos>   i can only say , ` no , i shall not ;' and then they say again , ` yes , you will ,' and there is an end of it ."  <eos>   emma found it really time to be at home ; the visit had already lasted long ; and on examining watches , so much of the morning was perceived to be gone , that mrs . weston and her companion taking leave also , could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates , before they set off for randalls .  <eos>   a reasonable visit paid , mr . weston began to move .--" he must be going .  <eos>   instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot , he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth .  <eos>   goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame .  <eos>   " she meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an anne cox should be ."  <eos>   anne found captain benwick again drawing near her .  <eos>   she spoke with a confidence which staggered , with a satisfaction which silenced , mr . knightley .  <eos>   but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny .  <eos>   in half a minute they were together .  <eos>   had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of harriet ' s mind , emma would have been amused by its variations .  <eos>   leave all that to me .  <eos>   at first , while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver , i saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world .  <eos>   he could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body ' s returning into their proper place the next morning .  <eos>   she had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of .  <eos>   " my dear emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves jane fairfax --"  <eos>   mr . woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest .-- to emma ' s entreaties and assurances succeeded mr . knightley ' s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion .-- they had all the assistance which isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and mrs . weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr . woodhouse ' s mind .-- it was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place .  <eos>   this was a device , i suppose , to sport with my curiosity , and exercise my talent of guessing .  <eos>   " nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps ," replied emma , smiling --" but , excuse me , it must be thought of ."  <eos>   they had taken out a young dog , who had spoilt their sport , and sent them back early .  <eos>   my dear ,' said i -- well , and just then came the note .  <eos>   she was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .  <eos>   when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle ' s generosity , i am mad with joy : but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her , and how little i deserve to be forgiven , i am mad with anger .  <eos>   i always say a woman cannot have too many resources -- and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society ."  <eos>   he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern .  <eos>   it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which i knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy .  <eos>   " i love your indignation ," said he ; " it is very natural .  <eos>   emma demurred .  <eos>   if it were war now , he would have settled it long ago .  <eos>   she frequently gave me hints of it .  <eos>   he wishes exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him ."  <eos>   she has been gone longer already than she intended ."  <eos>   " the clerks grow expert from habit .-- they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them .  <eos>   " frank was here in february for a fortnight ."  <eos>   he was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered .  <eos>   it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine ; but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm , and charles musgrove began , consequently , to feel no necessity for longer confinement .  <eos>   the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior .  <eos>   emma ' s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at mr .  <eos>   she was not sorry for the excuse .  <eos>   it was three weeks since she had heard at all .  <eos>   i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : i feel sure that he is not .  <eos>   if not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but miss hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set .  <eos>   his importance at enscombe was very evident .  <eos>   there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman ' s daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you ."  <eos>   i never compliment .  <eos>   emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend .  <eos>   i dare say he will come in when he knows who is here .  <eos>   i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs .  <eos>   he had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but emma ' s feelings were chiefly with jane , in the argument ; and on leaving randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of mr . knightley ' s high superiority of character .  <eos>   if i had not promoted mr . weston ' s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all .  <eos>   excepting one short period of her life , she had never , since the age of fourteen , never since the loss of her dear mother , known the happiness of being listened to , or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste .  <eos>   and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense , true and steady .  <eos>   " why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole .  <eos>   it darted through her , with the speed of an arrow , that mr . knightley must marry no one but herself !  <eos>   you think so , do not you ?"  <eos>   you and mr . elton are one as clever as the other .  <eos>   the eltons walked together ; mr . knightley took charge of miss bates and jane ; and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill .  <eos>   no , it was not regret which made anne ' s heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free .  <eos>   aye , i remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic -- i knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying i had none about me !-- oh !  <eos>   " my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest ," continued mrs . elton ; " and that will be our time for exploring .  <eos>   " there is no denying it ," he replied .  <eos>   they will be so near their own stable ."  <eos>   the child had a good night , and was going on well the next day .  <eos>   i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; " don ' t do this ," and " don ' t do that ;" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them ."  <eos>   and now i come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation .  <eos>   " miss smith !-- oh !-- i had not observed .-- you are extremely obliging -- and if i were not an old married man .-- but my dancing days are over , mrs . weston .  <eos>   harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly .  <eos>   a short period of exquisite felicity followed , and but a short one .  <eos>   i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to - day ."  <eos>   the two families had always been on excellent terms , there being no pride on one side , and no envy on the other , and only such a consciousness of superiority in the miss musgroves , as made them pleased to improve their cousins .  <eos>   mrs . weston would be at ease .  <eos>   mrs . weston told me you were here .-- oh !  <eos>   " you are silent , miss fairfax -- but i hope you mean to take an interest in this news .  <eos>   " by all means , if you can ."  <eos>   there was no time for farther remark or explanation .  <eos>   but , however , i found afterwards from patty , that william said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil .  <eos>   they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere ."  <eos>   woodhouse , who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined even by him , stirred no more ; and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that mrs . weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need .  <eos>   emma hoped it must rapidly work harriet ' s cure ; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much .-- it was not to be doubted that poor harriet ' s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve , and her own share in the story , under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him , had in all likelihood been given also .  <eos>   you answer as discreetly as she could do herself .  <eos>   but miss bates soon came --" very happy and obliged "-- but emma ' s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner .  <eos>   harriet had business at ford ' s .-- emma thought it most prudent to go with her .  <eos>   she could only hang over little charles , with most disordered feelings .  <eos>   she lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite .  <eos>   " i cannot think there is any danger of it ," was emma ' s calm answer -- " and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax ' s situation and understand what her home has been , with colonel and mrs . campbell , i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown ."  <eos>   he had hoped she would speak again , but she did not .  <eos>   mary need not have feared her sister ' s being in any degree prepared for the news .  <eos>   i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description .  <eos>   it is natural , and it is honourable .-- yes , honourable , i think , to chuse so well and so gratefully .-- but that it will be a fortunate preference is more that i can promise .  <eos>   every thing so good !"  <eos>   there was a family of cousins within a walk of uppercross , in less affluent circumstances , who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures : they would come at any time , and help play at anything , or dance anywhere ; and anne , very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post , played country dances to them by the hour together ; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove more than anything else , and often drew this compliment ;-- " well done , miss anne !  <eos>   there is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance .  <eos>   sir walter , without hesitation , declared the admiral to be the best - looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and the admiral , with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park , " i thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at taunton .  <eos>   mr . perry is not gone ."  <eos>   no husbands and wives ," with so interesting a consciousness , that emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once .  <eos>   then she is no rule for mrs . churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld ."  <eos>   mr . knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade .  <eos>   emma encouraged her talkativeness -- amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of mrs . martin ' s having " _two_ parlours , two very good parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large as mrs . goddard ' s drawing - room ; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five - and - twenty years with her ; and of their having eight cows , two of them alderneys , and one a little welch cow , a very pretty little welch cow indeed ; and of mrs . martin ' s saying as she was so fond of it , it should be called _her_ cow ; and of their having a very handsome summer - house in their garden , where some day next year they were all to drink tea :-- a very handsome summer - house , large enough to hold a dozen people ."  <eos>   she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him .  <eos>   if there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment .  <eos>   i have observed it all my life .  <eos>   a mrs . knightley for them all to give way to !-- no -- mr .  <eos>   said anne .  <eos>   mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the admiral ' s family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant .  <eos>   i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour .  <eos>   i did not know that i had fixed a day , but as he says i did , i am going now ."  <eos>   here was a dangerous opening .  <eos>   but nobody heard , or , at least , nobody answered her .  <eos>   it need not detain us long .  <eos>   she might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if i had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as i used to think him .  <eos>   " here have i ," said she , " actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man .  <eos>   if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now , it might augur something .  <eos>   there probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference ; mr . dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to miss campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds .  <eos>   after tea , mr . and mrs . weston , and mr . elton sat down with mr . woodhouse to cards .  <eos>   " you are sick of prosperity and indulgence .  <eos>   emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you .  <eos>   emma found that it was not mr . weston ' s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger .  <eos>   i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs .  <eos>   " miss elliot , i am sure you are tired ," cried mrs croft .  <eos>   that tooth of her ' s and those freckles .  <eos>   the case is , you see , that the campbells are going to ireland .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   _he_ had done it .  <eos>   their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three .  <eos>   she liked his open manners , but a little less of open - heartedness would have made him a higher character .-- general benevolence , but not general friendship , made a man what he ought to be .-- she could fancy such a man .  <eos>   anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from lady russell .  <eos>   she brought no name , no blood , no alliance .  <eos>   he came down by yesterday ' s coach , and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast , to report his proceedings , first on my affairs , and then on his own .  <eos>   their first pause was at the crown inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one of the sort , where a couple of pair of post - horses were kept , more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added ; it had been built many years ago for a ball - room , and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous , dancing state , had been occasionally used as such ;-- but such brilliant days had long passed away , and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half - gentlemen of the place .  <eos>   you pass it over very handsomely -- but you were perfectly right ."  <eos>   " our amiable young man is a very weak young man , if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others .  <eos>   " what does all that signify ?  <eos>   it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion ; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again .  <eos>   " yes , here i am , my good friend ; and here i have been so long , that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that i am waiting for my lord and master .  <eos>   can it be neptune ?  <eos>   " has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not ?"  <eos>   he would do any good to her , or her family ; but --"  <eos>   the misfortune of harriet ' s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival .  <eos>   " wentworth was the very name !  <eos>   two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over - throw of every thing .  <eos>   her father and sister were glad to see her , for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture , and met her with kindness .  <eos>   mr . elton , in very good spirits , was one of the first to walk in .  <eos>   cried emma , turning her glowing cheeks towards him ; for , while she spoke , it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs . goddard ' s in his way .  <eos>   yes , i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr . and mrs . dixon .  <eos>   for i think you have a little cold , and patty has been washing the kitchen .'--` oh !  <eos>   the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any body to .  <eos>   she had , however , one very intimate friend , a sensible , deserving woman , who had been brought , by strong attachment to herself , to settle close by her , in the village of kellynch ; and on her kindness and advice , lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters .  <eos>   decidedly , i think , a very gentleman - like man ."  <eos>   surry is the garden of england ."  <eos>   he was silent .  <eos>   it was precisely what emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing .  <eos>   his cold politeness , his ceremonious grace , were worse than anything .  <eos>   if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me .  <eos>   books of engravings , drawers of medals , cameos , corals , shells , and every other family collection within his cabinets , had been prepared for his old friend , to while away the morning ; and the kindness had perfectly answered .  <eos>   you and miss smith , and miss fairfax , will be three , and the two miss coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room ."  <eos>   let my accents swell to mickleham on one side , and dorking on the other .  <eos>   a new sort of way this , for a young fellow to be making love , by breaking his mistress ' s head , is not it , miss elliot ?  <eos>   " yes , our good mrs . elton .  <eos>   there can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to dr shirley , after his illness , last spring twelve - month .  <eos>   but a week must pass ; only a week , in anne ' s reckoning , and then , she supposed , they must meet ; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week .  <eos>   do come in .  <eos>   mr . john knightley proved more talkative than his brother .  <eos>   -- highbury , with mrs . weston , stood for hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him .  <eos>   and i always thought you meant it ."  <eos>   " you have heard of a certain frank churchill , i presume ," he continued -- " and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name ."  <eos>   " when i talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years ," said john knightley , " i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings .  <eos>   we will go to hartfield afterwards .  <eos>   emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance .  <eos>   " and so , i made her go .  <eos>   he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith , or speaking to those who were close to her .-- emma saw it .  <eos>   that was the kind action ; that was the noble benevolence and generosity ; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth ."  <eos>   that is the reason of her writing out of rule , as we call it ; for , in the common course , we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday ."  <eos>   my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , lords of the earth !  <eos>   she found something else must be done .  <eos>   she had hardly been able to speak a word , and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness .  <eos>   elton ?"  <eos>   i will do my best .  <eos>   come , jane , take my other arm ."  <eos>   but not a bit did walter stir .  <eos>   i must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend ."  <eos>   well , time does fly indeed !-- and my memory is very bad .  <eos>   they could think of no one else .  <eos>   this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him .  <eos>   -- was a question , however , which did not augur much .  <eos>   her sensibilities , i suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness .  <eos>   she , therefore , said no more for some time .  <eos>   said i , ` it is miss woodhouse : i am sure you will like to see her .'  <eos>   but now , another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these .  <eos>   you make the most of it , i know ," cried louisa , " but if it were really so , i should do just the same in her place .  <eos>   " well , my dear , and did you get there safely ?-- and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter ?-- i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming .  <eos>   yes , perfectly .-- why do you make a doubt of it ?"  <eos>   i am rather proud of little george .  <eos>   it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other .  <eos>   it is not a connexion to gratify ; but if mr . churchill does not feel that , why should we ?  <eos>   to mr . john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility .  <eos>   anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking .  <eos>   " no , i have not ; i know nothing ; pray tell me ."  <eos>   perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but mr . weston had been almost as uneasy as herself .-- in ten minutes , however , the child had been perfectly well again .  <eos>   do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time ?-- do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ?"  <eos>   for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual .-- you might not have distinguished how i came , by my look or manner ."  <eos>   lady russell could not hear the door - bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father ' s grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him .  <eos>   isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband ."  <eos>   you need not be afraid , miss elliot , of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected ."  <eos>   she thought nothing of his attachment , and was insulted by his hopes .  <eos>   if she can hesitate as to ` yes ,' she ought to say ` no ' directly .  <eos>   miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl .  <eos>   mr . weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make mr . woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away .  <eos>   when harriet had closed her evidence , she appealed to her dear miss woodhouse , to say whether she had not good ground for hope .  <eos>   the evil day was put off .  <eos>   it had been a great disappointment to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed , so impatient was he to shew his gratitude , by seeing captain wentworth under his own roof , and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars .  <eos>   the answer was , " oh , no ; never ; she has quite given up dancing .  <eos>   the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry .  <eos>   " not at all .  <eos>   " yes ," sighed anne , " we shall , indeed , be known to be related to them !"  <eos>   " what sort of looking man is mr .  <eos>   i met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son ' s hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to mrs . weston .  <eos>   there is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance .  <eos>   the gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable ;-- but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at south end , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin .  <eos>   we ought to be acquainted with enscombe , and with mrs . churchill ' s temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do .  <eos>   charles is out shooting .  <eos>   she would not stir a step , nor drop a hint .  <eos>   not that i think mr . martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up .  <eos>   her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot .  <eos>   mr . elton had retreated into the card - room , looking ( emma trusted ) very foolish .  <eos>   think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of mr . knightley ' s marrying jane fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt .  <eos>   oh !-- you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for mr . weston has told me himself .  <eos>   this was the amount of the whole story ,-- of his communication and of harriet ' s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech .-- he dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to mrs . goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr . knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself .  <eos>   " you are very obliging .-- frank will be extremely happy , i am sure .-- he is to be in town next week , if not sooner .  <eos>   .  <eos>   william larkins mentioned it here .  <eos>   " no , i do not know that mr . wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except --  <eos>   she would be a loser in every way .  <eos>   " oh !"  <eos>   " and i am quite serious too , i assure you ," replied mrs . elton gaily , " in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us ."  <eos>   campbell ."  <eos>   isabella does not seem more my sister ; has never excited a greater interest ; perhaps hardly so great .  <eos>   plain dealing was always best .  <eos>   mr . perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could ."  <eos>   charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of lyme .  <eos>   sir walter wanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond .  <eos>   which of them is it ?-- i charge you by all that is sacred , not to attempt concealment ."  <eos>   mr . weston directed the whole , officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage , and every body was in good time .  <eos>   " no , no ; your room is full enough .  <eos>   mr elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open .  <eos>   to speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness .  <eos>   " i felt my luck , admiral , i assure you ;" replied captain wentworth , seriously .  <eos>   to you -- to my two daughters -- i may venture on the truth .  <eos>   you have not heard all that you ought to hear .  <eos>   she had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart , for he stopped to hand her out .  <eos>   tea passed pleasantly , and nobody seemed in a hurry to move .  <eos>   said she , beginning again when they were all in the street .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and mr . woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor isabella ;-- which poor isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness .  <eos>   oh , no !  <eos>   i hope not of a putrid infectious sort .  <eos>   the expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know .  <eos>   i cannot doubt it .  <eos>   " i think lady russell would like him .  <eos>   let me recommend bath to you .  <eos>   " very well ," replied emma ; " a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better i shall be pleased .  <eos>   said he quietly , and looking at her ; " of what nature ?"  <eos>   and if they are , i only beg you to send them home ."  <eos>   goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame .  <eos>   he had expressed himself as to coming , with more than common certainty .  <eos>   they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " i merely asked , whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth ."  <eos>   but she was not wanted to speak .  <eos>   such were elizabeth elliot ' s sentiments and sensations ; such the cares to alloy , the agitations to vary , the sameness and the elegance , the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life ; such the feelings to give interest to a long , uneventful residence in one country circle , to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad , no talents or accomplishments for home , to occupy .  <eos>   quite wonderful how she does her hair !-- no hairdresser from london i think could .-- ah !  <eos>   those letters are convenient passports .  <eos>   emma ' s answer was ready at the first word .  <eos>   he and his wife had taken their intended drive , and were returning home .  <eos>   and who but mr . knightley could know and bear with mr . woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable !-- the difficulty of disposing of poor mr . woodhouse had been always felt in her husband ' s plans and her own , for a marriage between frank and emma .  <eos>   " my dear miss fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for .-- i hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well .  <eos>   do you recommend this side ?-- well , i am sure , mr . churchill -- only it seems too good -- but just as you please .  <eos>   ` it is only mrs . cole ,' said i , ` depend upon it .  <eos>   his wife gave him a look which invited him in ; and , while he was coming round , added , " now , dearest emma , let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease , and incline him to be satisfied with the match .  <eos>   their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross ; and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place , which had been taken , and her regret that mrs clay should still be with them , anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick , than her own father ' s house in camden place , or her own sister ' s intimacy with mrs clay .  <eos>   he paused a moment , again smiling , with his eyes fixed on her face .  <eos>   mrs clay was right .  <eos>   " your feelings are singular .  <eos>   this , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road .-- so frank writes word .  <eos>   he had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs ; had heard voices , mirth continually ; thought they must be a most delightful set of people , longed to be with them , but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself .  <eos>   " oh !"  <eos>   she is dead !"  <eos>   it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william larkins .  <eos>   uppercross excited no interest , kellynch very little : it was all bath .  <eos>   chapter xviii  <eos>   such as mrs . elton appeared to her on this second interview , such she appeared whenever they met again ,-- self - important , presuming , familiar , ignorant , and ill - bred .  <eos>   you talk of being proud ; i am called proud , i know , and i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise ; for our pride , if investigated , would have the same object , i have no doubt , though the kind may seem a little different .  <eos>   " oh !"  <eos>   they called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as i understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain .-- she made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving .  <eos>   i think they judge wisely .  <eos>   he will be glad to hear it ."  <eos>   as to the pretence of trying her native air , i look upon that as a mere excuse .-- in the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body ' s native air do for them in the months of january , february , and march ?  <eos>   she would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all - sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother ' s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important .-- it had a high claim to forbearance .  <eos>   his letters disgust me ."  <eos>   he said nothing worth hearing -- looked without seeing -- admired without intelligence -- listened without knowing what she said .  <eos>   you are extremely troublesome .  <eos>   skilful has been the hand !"  <eos>   a mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress .  <eos>   " don ' t say i was cross .  <eos>   " but , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is april , and june , or say even july , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us .  <eos>   but , however , i found afterwards from patty , that william said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil .  <eos>   i dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them the other day .  <eos>   you may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , i made my way directly to miss bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once .  <eos>   and not only did it appear that he was expected , and speedily , but the musgroves , in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor dick , and very high respect for his character , stamped as it was by poor dick ' s having been six months under his care , and mentioning him in strong , though not perfectly well - spelt praise , as " a fine dashing felow , only two perticular about the schoolmaster ," were bent on introducing themselves , and seeking his acquaintance , as soon as they could hear of his arrival .  <eos>   the carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage ;-- one morning , i remember , he came to me quite in despair ."  <eos>   she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty .  <eos>   i should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and i cannot help beginning ."  <eos>   and take it altogether , now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge , there is not one that we like better than this .  <eos>   absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude .  <eos>   in person , she was inferior to both sisters , and had , even in her bloom , only reached the dignity of being " a fine girl ."  <eos>   " from something that he said , my dear emma , i rather imagine --"  <eos>   he could not understand it ; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least -- symptoms of admiration on his side , which , having once observed , he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish to escape any of emma ' s errors of imagination .  <eos>   it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion , to foresee the smiles , the sneers , the merriment it would prompt at his expense ; the mortification and disdain of his brother , the thousand inconveniences to himself .-- could it be ?-- no ; it was impossible .  <eos>   there was too much domestic happiness in his brother ' s house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; isabella was too much like emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer .-- he had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning ' s post had conveyed the history of jane fairfax .-- then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer .  <eos>   they had left louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them .  <eos>   emma was very compassionate ; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness , her counsel and her patience , as from her purse .  <eos>   mr . john knightley smiled , and replied ,  <eos>   go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well .  <eos>   he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it .  <eos>   and how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude , of concurrence , of common kindness !  <eos>   how quick come the reasons for approving what we like !  <eos>   the course of true love never did run smooth --  <eos>   " these are the sights , harriet , to do one good .  <eos>   captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home , to stay as long as he liked , being as thoroughly the object of the admiral ' s fraternal kindness as of his wife ' s .  <eos>   elizabeth was certainly very handsome , with well - bred , elegant manners , and her character might never have been penetrated by mr elliot , knowing her but in public , and when very young himself .  <eos>   this is all that i can relate of the how , where , and when .  <eos>   do not let us be too solemn on the business .  <eos>   cried jane , with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure --" there would have been no danger .  <eos>   she made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in brunswick square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when mr . knightley startled her , by saying ,  <eos>   the tone implied some old acquaintance -- and how could she possibly guess ?  <eos>   did you ever hear of that ?-- a water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard .  <eos>   he certainly knew what was right , nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed ; but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct .  <eos>   " _i_ sick of prosperity and indulgence !  <eos>   it had just occurred to mrs . weston that mrs . elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction .-- emma heard the sad truth with fortitude .  <eos>   after the note i sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one ."  <eos>   i could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least ."  <eos>   " me !  <eos>   " so do i , anne ," said charles .  <eos>   " and i do assure you , ma ' am ," pursued mrs croft , " that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man - of - war ; i speak , you know , of the higher rates .  <eos>   i have read worse charades .  <eos>   " perhaps it is as well ," said frank churchill , as he attended emma to her carriage .  <eos>   other poultry - yards in the neighbourhood also suffered .-- pilfering was _housebreaking_ to mr . woodhouse ' s fears .-- he was very uneasy ; and but for the sense of his son - in - law ' s protection , would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life .  <eos>   she could not endure its noise .  <eos>   could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all !  <eos>   but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard .  <eos>   but then , is not it the same with many other professions , perhaps most other ?  <eos>   if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled ."  <eos>   all his sanguine expectations , all his confidence had been justified .  <eos>   anne ' s object was , not to be in the way of anybody ; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary , to keep with her brother and sister .  <eos>   dixon !"  <eos>   she had weathered it , however , and could truly say that it had done her good .  <eos>   the danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .  <eos>   emma was in no danger of forgetting .  <eos>   she was a clever young woman , who understood the art of pleasing -- the art of pleasing , at least , at kellynch hall ; and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot , as to have been already staying there more than once , in spite of all that lady russell , who thought it a friendship quite out of place , could hint of caution and reserve .  <eos>   captain benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance .  <eos>   i have heard so much in praise of mr . frank churchill .-- at the same time it is fair to observe , that i am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others .  <eos>   then returning to his former earnest tone -- " my first wish for all whom i am interested in , is that they should be firm .  <eos>   " but , my dear sir ," cried mr . weston , " if emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party ."  <eos>   emma seriously hoped she would .  <eos>   these were charming feelings -- but not lasting .  <eos>   in the mean while she was in the carriage .  <eos>   there is such perfect good - temper and good - will in mr . elton as one cannot but value ."  <eos>   i never had much opinion of the sea air ."  <eos>   look at her .  <eos>   their children had more modern minds and manners .  <eos>   the young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on harriet ' s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own .  <eos>   she meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the abbey mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future .  <eos>   " i must spend some time with them ; i am sure they will want it ;-- afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself .  <eos>   to some of the best - looking of these good people henrietta was consigned , for , though partially revived , she was quite helpless ; and in this manner , anne walking by her side , and charles attending to his wife , they set forward , treading back with feelings unutterable , the ground , which so lately , so very lately , and so light of heart , they had passed along .  <eos>   oh dear , no !  <eos>   let us wait , therefore , for this letter .  <eos>   " i have heard it asserted ," said john knightley , " that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough .  <eos>   you , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbell ' s account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr . elton and miss hawkins ."  <eos>   they ascended and passed him ; and as they passed , anne ' s face caught his eye , and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration , which she could not be insensible of .  <eos>   mr . knightley , i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case .  <eos>   i will bring friends with me ."  <eos>   he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith , or speaking to those who were close to her .-- emma saw it .  <eos>   i dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and i was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement .-- had she refused , i should have gone mad .-- but you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this ?-- what did you look forward to ?-- to any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness .  <eos>   i will answer for the gentleman ' s indifference ."  <eos>   " mr . martin , i suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ?  <eos>   i thought i could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you .  <eos>   harriet was too intent on the lines to hear .  <eos>   a miss hawkins --"  <eos>   i do not reckon the hayters as anybody .  <eos>   she has a fault .  <eos>   she means it , i know ."  <eos>   who makes you their confidant ?"  <eos>   i thought i should have fainted .  <eos>   but perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world ."  <eos>   it was all general approbation and smoothness ; nothing delineated or distinguished .  <eos>   chapter iii  <eos>   i have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless i can believe myself fit to be seen ."  <eos>   mrs . elton is very good - natured and agreeable , and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be .  <eos>   [ emma by jane austen ]  <eos>   sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected .  <eos>   my poor mother does not know how to bear it .  <eos>   but now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in -- observing , as she proposed it to harriet , that , as well as she could calculate , they were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax .  <eos>   cried harriet .  <eos>   miss woodhouse , what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book !  <eos>   " i think , harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr . martin .  <eos>   i had not thought of mrs . dixon .  <eos>   i dare say , miss fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to broadwood himself .  <eos>   it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend ' s leaving highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well .  <eos>   how they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter ' s carriage and horses were actually at hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for harriet also .  <eos>   " i have very little to say for my own conduct .-- i was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased .-- an old story , probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding .  <eos>   now , however , we must wish you and mrs . bates good morning ."  <eos>   " mrs . dixon !  <eos>   the evil day was put off .  <eos>   is not that your idea ?"  <eos>   some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs . weston ' s drawing - room ;-- mr . elton must compose his joyous looks , and mr . john knightley disperse his ill - humour .  <eos>   mrs . weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world .  <eos>   if he were , he would have done this differently .  <eos>   harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love .  <eos>   the event acquitted her of all the fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints .  <eos>   this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but i do not know that i expect it will ; i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man -- i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy .-- his feelings are warm , but i can imagine them rather changeable .-- every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved .-- i shall do very well again after a little while -- and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and i shall have been let off easily ."  <eos>   look at my shoes .  <eos>   she meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the abbey mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future .  <eos>   impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , mrs . suckling ' s own family , and mrs . bragge ' s ; but mrs . smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood :-- lives only four miles from maple grove .  <eos>   mrs . elton , as elegant as lace and pearls could make her , he looked at in silence -- wanting only to observe enough for isabella ' s information -- but miss fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl , and he could talk to her .  <eos>   when we talked about him , it was as clear as possible ."  <eos>   a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings !  <eos>   intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question .  <eos>   " yes , sir , a mr elliot , a gentleman of large fortune , came in last night from sidmouth .  <eos>   impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , mrs . suckling ' s own family , and mrs . bragge ' s ; but mrs . smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood :-- lives only four miles from maple grove .  <eos>   she was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy .  <eos>   so , lady russell would not get out .  <eos>   i must get on to kingston as fast as i can ."  <eos>   " you are extremely kind ," replied miss bates , highly gratified ; " you who are such a judge , and write so beautifully yourself .  <eos>   soon afterwards he began again ,  <eos>   such a very kind attention -- and so thoughtful an attention !-- the sort of thing that so few men would think of .  <eos>   " don ' t talk of it , don ' t talk of it ," he cried .  <eos>   do not pity me till i saw her wan , sick looks .-- i reached highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , i was certain of a good chance of finding her alone .-- i was not disappointed ; and at last i was not disappointed either in the object of my journey .  <eos>   husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain .  <eos>   captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part , and to be soon followed by the two ladies .  <eos>   i do not advise the custard .  <eos>   but his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the campbells , he named the name of dixon .-- emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing .  <eos>   certainly not a great match for louisa musgrove , but a million times better than marrying among the hayters ."  <eos>   " the profession has its utility , but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it ."  <eos>   it was very lucky , for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account ; and i am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; i have a great opinion of her .  <eos>   chapter v  <eos>   all anne ' s wishes had been for the latter .  <eos>   ` well ,' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now .'  <eos>   to me , who live so much alone , her conversation , i assure you , is a treat ."  <eos>   i have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january , except charles hayter , who had been calling much oftener than was welcome .  <eos>   emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried ,  <eos>   elton ?"  <eos>   " what a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces .  <eos>   so long ago as the 7th of november , ( as i am going to read to you ,) and has never been well since .  <eos>   he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow .  <eos>   she had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day .  <eos>   " but really , i am half ashamed , and wish i had never taken up the idea ."  <eos>   pray take care , miss woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase -- rather darker and narrower than one could wish .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   i really am a most troublesome companion to you both , but i hope i am not often so ill - equipped .  <eos>   but the usual fate of anne attended her , in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on .  <eos>   he knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge .-- bad .-- he ought not to have formed the engagement .--` his father ' s disposition :'-- he is unjust , however , to his father .  <eos>   the heat was excessive ; he had never suffered any thing like it -- almost wished he had staid at home -- nothing killed him like heat -- he could bear any degree of cold , etc ., but heat was intolerable -- and he sat down , at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr . woodhouse ' s fire , looking very deplorable .  <eos>   to be claimed as a good , though in an improper style , is at least better than being rejected as no good at all ; and anne , glad to be thought of some use , glad to have anything marked out as a duty , and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country , and her own dear country , readily agreed to stay .  <eos>   he had found her agitated and low .-- frank churchill was a villain .-- he heard her declare that she had never loved him .  <eos>   she knew herself to be of the first utility to the child ; and what was it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant , making himself agreeable to others ?  <eos>   it would be such a delight to have her picture !"  <eos>   she would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out .  <eos>   true affection only could have prompted it ."  <eos>   no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper .  <eos>   had she not imagined herself consulting his good , even more than her own , she could hardly have given him up .  <eos>   you have not heard all that you ought to hear .  <eos>   give him a book , and he will read all day long ."  <eos>   a cousin of mr . suckling , mrs . bragge , had such an infinity of applications ; every body was anxious to be in her family , for she moves in the first circle .  <eos>   you know we have settled all that already .  <eos>   tea was carrying round , and mr . weston , having said all that he wanted , soon took the opportunity of walking away .  <eos>   " there is my news :-- i thought it would interest you ," said mr . knightley , with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them .  <eos>   she considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure , and saw no dignity in anything short of it .  <eos>   he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late .  <eos>   it is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other ."  <eos>   mr . elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harriet ' s head .  <eos>   " mrs clay ," said she , warmly , " never forgets who she is ; and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , i can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people .  <eos>   " yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off .  <eos>   the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family .  <eos>   " very much to the honour of both ," was the handsome reply .  <eos>   i never was equal to this ."  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   " thank you ," said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed .  <eos>   he was wishing to confide in her -- perhaps to consult her ;-- cost her what it would , she would listen .  <eos>   they could think of no one else .  <eos>   harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of .  <eos>   uppercross excited no interest , kellynch very little : it was all bath .  <eos>   lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject , and gave it much serious consideration .  <eos>   i am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond ;-- and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree .  <eos>   it is over !"  <eos>   but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge !  <eos>   he shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy .  <eos>   they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley ' s .  <eos>   emma laughed , and replied ,  <eos>   i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs . goddard .  <eos>   and so excellent in the church !  <eos>   he left me not half an hour ago ."  <eos>   it ought to be no recommendation to _you_ .  <eos>   ."  <eos>   " will you ?"  <eos>   " oh yes , papa .  <eos>   " had you any idea ," cried harriet , " of his being in love with her ?-- you , perhaps , might .-- you ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body ' s heart ; but nobody else --"  <eos>   " that is ," replied mr . knightley , " she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all .  <eos>   harriet said , " very true ," and she " would not think about it ;" but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else ; and emma , at last , in order to put the martins out of her head , was obliged to hurry on the news , which she had meant to give with so much tender caution ; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry , ashamed or only amused , at such a state of mind in poor harriet -- such a conclusion of mr . elton ' s importance with her !  <eos>   " if it would be good to her , i am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion .  <eos>   that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here .  <eos>   my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us .  <eos>   mrs . bates , mrs . perry , mrs . goddard and others , were a good deal behind - hand in knowledge of the world , but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged .  <eos>   every comfort of life knocked off !  <eos>   woodhouse ?-- i am so glad .-- quite out of my power .-- such a happy little circle as you find us here .-- yes , indeed .-- charming young man !-- that is -- so very friendly ; i mean good mr .  <eos>   and so late !  <eos>   " here is something quite new to me .  <eos>   that he was a sensible man , an agreeable man , that he talked well , professed good opinions , seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle , this was all clear enough .  <eos>   do not be impatient , emma ; it will all come out too soon ."  <eos>   a few days had made a change indeed !  <eos>   emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to mrs . bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ' s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods ,  <eos>   emma ' s going away directly after tea might be giving offence .  <eos>   but here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him .  <eos>   " don ' t say i was cross .  <eos>   they , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed .  <eos>   " i was going to observe , sir ," said frank churchill , " that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body ' s catching cold -- so much less danger at the crown than at randalls !  <eos>   goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame .  <eos>   miss woodhouse must excuse me .  <eos>   " but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman , and as if women were all fine ladies , instead of rational creatures .  <eos>   where could have been the attraction ?  <eos>   personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions .  <eos>   ay , this comes of the peace .  <eos>   there he had not always the patience that could have been wished .  <eos>   .  <eos>   -- and when mrs . bates was saying something to emma , whispered farther , " we do not say a word of any _assistance_ that perry might have ; not a word of a certain young physician from windsor .-- oh !  <eos>   there was no denying that those brothers had penetration .  <eos>   captain benwick obeyed , and charles at the same moment , disengaging himself from his wife , they were both with him ; and louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them , and everything was done that anne had prompted , but in vain ; while captain wentworth , staggering against the wall for his support , exclaimed in the bitterest agony --  <eos>   very true .  <eos>   part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath ; but bristol was her home , the very heart of bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained -- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived .  <eos>   mr . weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation .  <eos>   and so you must judge for yourself , whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not ."  <eos>   emma ' s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law ' s breaking out .  <eos>   " no , it by no means wanted strength -- it was not a large hand , but very clear and certainly strong .  <eos>   " i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves ."  <eos>   when he came away , she was going to walk out with captain benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good .  <eos>   " thank you .  <eos>   " i am quite sure ," he replied , speaking very distinctly , " that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so .  <eos>   in fact , anne could never see the crape round his hat , without fearing that she was the inexcusable one , in attributing to him such imaginations ; for though his marriage had not been very happy , still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved .  <eos>   then she is no rule for mrs . churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld ."  <eos>   how very comfortable they make it ;-- impossible to feel cold with such precautions .  <eos>   " ah !--( shaking his head )-- the uncertainty of when i may be able to return !-- i shall try for it with a zeal !-- it will be the object of all my thoughts and cares !-- and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring -- but i am afraid -- they did not stir last spring -- i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever ."  <eos>   every body knows what is due to _you_ ."  <eos>   she has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself .  <eos>   " how is mary ?"  <eos>   leave shame to her .  <eos>   i want you to save yourself from greater pain .  <eos>   the tone , the look , with which " thank god !"  <eos>   harriet , mr . elton , and mr . knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them ;-- the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; mr . woodhouse ' s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing .  <eos>   miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have ."  <eos>   she could now answer as she ought ; and was happy to feel , when mrs croft ' s next words explained it to be mr wentworth of whom she spoke , that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother .  <eos>   she had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , " much the same -- not better ."  <eos>   with this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr . martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .  <eos>   it will be bad enough for the horses ."  <eos>   that is quite -- i suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting .  <eos>   these feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while mrs . weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself .  <eos>   henrietta asked him what he thought of you , when they went away , and he said , ` you were so altered he should not have known you again .'"  <eos>   it had not been possible for him to spend less ; he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot was imperiously called on to do ; but blameless as he was , he was not only growing dreadfully in debt , but was hearing of it so often , that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer , even partially , from his daughter .  <eos>   they might all have hoped to rise by harriet ' s acquaintance : and besides , what was the value of harriet ' s description ?-- so easily pleased -- so little discerning ;-- what signified her praise ?  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   do you think this is a good plan ?"  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " me !"  <eos>   with the exception , perhaps , of admiral and mrs croft , who seemed particularly attached and happy , ( anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples ), there could have been no two hearts so open , no tastes so similar , no feelings so in unison , no countenances so beloved .  <eos>   i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it !-- it was but a very few days before i had my sore throat -- just before mr . and mrs . john knightley came -- i think the very evening .-- do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister ?-- but , as you had none about you , and knew i had , you desired me to supply him ; and so i took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me .  <eos>   " it is one that i shall never change , however ."  <eos>   " or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument -- which must now be shut up in london , untouched by any body ."  <eos>   as they were turning into the grounds , mr . perry passed by on horseback .  <eos>   this was the occurrence :-- the coles had been settled some years in highbury , and were very good sort of people -- friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel .  <eos>   " from something that he said , my dear emma , i rather imagine --"  <eos>   " what news do you mean ?"  <eos>   .  <eos>   mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister ' s in a common way , but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound .  <eos>   -- seemed to burst from an overcharged heart , and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her , even towards some of those who loved her best .  <eos>   a submissive spirit might be patient , a strong understanding would supply resolution , but here was something more ; here was that elasticity of mind , that disposition to be comforted , that power of turning readily from evil to good , and of finding employment which carried her out of herself , which was from nature alone .  <eos>   you only mean , that he intends it ."  <eos>   it is a retired place .  <eos>   his first proposition and request , that the dance begun at mr . cole ' s should be finished there -- that the same party should be collected , and the same musician engaged , met with the readiest acquiescence .  <eos>   one morning , about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth being gone a - shooting together , as the sisters in the cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the mansion - house .  <eos>   " it is over !  <eos>   if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish .  <eos>   it is a retired place .  <eos>   i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible ."  <eos>   frank comes to - morrow -- i had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty -- he is at oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; i knew it would be so .  <eos>   " that you do not give another half - second to the subject .  <eos>   frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax ' s situation in life .  <eos>   the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriet ' s mind was not to be talked away .  <eos>   " not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit .-- if one leads you wrong , i am sure the other tells you of it ."  <eos>   she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ' s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home .  <eos>   " very ."  <eos>   sir walter has resented it .  <eos>   he had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection , and was just the happy man he ought to be ; talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and , with cordial , fearless smiles , now addressing all the young ladies of the place , to whom , a few weeks ago , he would have been more cautiously gallant .  <eos>   what years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him !-- assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for jane fairfax ' s character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour ,-- equality of situation -- i mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one -- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants .-- a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _her_ regard , must , i think , be the happiest of mortals .-- frank churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune .  <eos>   he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylor ' s merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouse ' s character , than miss woodhouse miss taylor ' s .  <eos>   where is she ?-- oh !  <eos>   weston .-- so it proved ;-- for when happily released from mr . elton , and seated by mr . weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her ,  <eos>   there are several odd - looking men walking about here , who , i am told , are sailors .  <eos>   one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance .  <eos>   " very true , my love , very true .  <eos>   how can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ?  <eos>   if he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , i dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had .  <eos>   it is the fault of her face that she has them not ."  <eos>   now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs . elton , of which mr . weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again :-- it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of mrs . elton ' s party !  <eos>   books of engravings , drawers of medals , cameos , corals , shells , and every other family collection within his cabinets , had been prepared for his old friend , to while away the morning ; and the kindness had perfectly answered .  <eos>   she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .  <eos>   but as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist mrs harville , i think it need be only one .  <eos>   " she has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me ," she continued --" like la baronne d ' almane on la comtesse d ' ostalis , in madame de genlis ' adelaide and theodore , and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan ."  <eos>   perry does not call it altogether a sickly season ."  <eos>   here it comes .  <eos>   i assure you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   emma listened , and looked , and soon perceived that frank churchill ' s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour .  <eos>   " it was her very particular friend , you know ."  <eos>   " colonel and mrs . campbell are to be in town again by midsummer ," said jane .  <eos>   even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane ."  <eos>   remember it ?  <eos>   reported fit for home service for a year or two , and so i was sent off to the west indies ."  <eos>   don ' t let us be severe , don ' t let us be in a hurry to condemn him .  <eos>   said mr . woodhouse , shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern .-- the ejaculation in emma ' s ear expressed , " ah !  <eos>   a piece of paper was found on the table this morning --( dropt , we suppose , by a fairy )-- containing a very pretty charade , and we have just copied it in ."  <eos>   " she had engaged to go as governess to mrs . smallridge ' s children -- a dear friend of mrs . elton ' s -- a neighbour of maple grove ; and , by the bye , i wonder how mrs . elton bears the disappointment ?"  <eos>   anne had called several times on her friend , before the existence of such a person was known in camden place .  <eos>   " not quite .  <eos>   " perhaps i intended you to say so , but i meant self - command .  <eos>   " no indeed i have not .  <eos>   said emma playfully .  <eos>   they were wretched comforters for one another ."  <eos>   " miss elliot , i am sure you are tired ," cried mrs croft .  <eos>   and once henry asked me for a knife , but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas .  <eos>   " i am happy you approved ," said emma , smiling ; " but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield ."  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   disputable , however , as might be the taste of such a termination , it was in itself a charming walk , and the view which closed it extremely pretty .-- the considerable slope , at nearly the foot of which the abbey stood , gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds ; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur , well clothed with wood ;-- and at the bottom of this bank , favourably placed and sheltered , rose the abbey mill farm , with meadows in front , and the river making a close and handsome curve around it .  <eos>   as for _his_ going , emma did not wish him to think it possible , the hours would be too late , and the party too numerous .  <eos>   i never saw mrs . weston better in my life -- never looking so well .  <eos>   yes , very .  <eos>   anne haggard , mary coarse , every face in the neighbourhood worsting , and the rapid increase of the crow ' s foot about lady russell ' s temples had long been a distress to him .  <eos>   " whom are you going to dance with ?"  <eos>   emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and mr . elton warmly added ,  <eos>   she knows their ways best ; but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present .  <eos>   mrs . weston told me you were here .-- oh !  <eos>   and i need not bring the whole family , you know ."  <eos>   they never could have been all three together , without her having stabbed jane fairfax ' s peace in a thousand instances ; and on box hill , perhaps , it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more .  <eos>   " it is over !  <eos>   how delightful !"  <eos>   or a mermaid ?  <eos>   " you know ," said she , " i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta ; and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made , she has no right to throw herself away .  <eos>   after waiting another moment --  <eos>   she is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school .  <eos>   the manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them .  <eos>   " it is very natural .  <eos>   time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject ."  <eos>   " i might not like them the better for that perhaps .  <eos>   his two other children were of very inferior value .  <eos>   frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch ; and though he did not say much , his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening .  <eos>   i have never seen either mr . or mrs . elton .  <eos>   emma knew this was too true for contradiction , and therefore said nothing .  <eos>   " he had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naivete ."  <eos>   she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself , to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother .  <eos>   she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate .  <eos>   after emma had talked about it for ten minutes , mr . woodhouse felt no unwillingness , and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself , with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him .  <eos>   said i to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( sir basil morley ).  <eos>   it is what we happily have never known any thing of ; but it must be a life of misery .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   she had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of .  <eos>   " i am quite sure ," he replied , speaking very distinctly , " that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so .  <eos>   " how do you do , mrs . ford ?  <eos>   emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you .  <eos>   " never , never !"  <eos>   and we agreed it would be best to have the harp , for it seems to amuse her more than the piano - forte .  <eos>   he was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about jane ' s age : and jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .  <eos>   emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr . weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass .  <eos>   he had frightened her a little about mr . elton ; but when she considered that mr . knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of mr . knightley ' s pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   nobody could be so imprudent !  <eos>   consider from how partial a quarter your information came .  <eos>   nothing could be pleasanter .  <eos>   i know what is due to my tenant ."  <eos>   hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth among the musgroves and their dependencies .  <eos>   " family connexions were always worth preserving , good company always worth seeking ; lady dalrymple had taken a house , for three months , in laura place , and would be living in style .  <eos>   if miss woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home ."  <eos>   that is , i _presume_ it to be so on her side , and i can _answer_ for its being so on his .  <eos>   it was a child ' s play , chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank churchill ' s part .  <eos>   the quiet , heart - felt satisfaction of the old lady , and the rapturous delight of her daughter -- who proved even too joyous to talk as usual , had been a gratifying , yet almost an affecting , scene .  <eos>   i am sure they were talking of me ; and i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me --( do you think he was , miss woodhouse ?)  <eos>   emma shall be an angel , and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella .  <eos>   for it is not five minutes since i received mrs . cole ' s note -- no , it cannot be more than five -- or at least ten -- for i had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out -- i was only gone down to speak to patty again about the pork -- jane was standing in the passage -- were not you , jane ?-- for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough .  <eos>   i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs . elton on this happy occasion ; i said that i hoped i _should_ in the course of the summer .  <eos>   better than nearer !  <eos>   he was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed .  <eos>   isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before .-- isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .  <eos>   she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed .-- there was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible .  <eos>   i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond ."  <eos>   depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing _you_ justice .  <eos>   mrs . weston looked surprized , and said , " i did not know that he ever had any such plan ."  <eos>   when the plan was made known to mary , however , there was an end of all peace in it .  <eos>   i do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one ' s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation .  <eos>   " well ," said anne , " i certainly am proud , too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place ."  <eos>   you can have no superior , but most true on mine .-- she is a complete angel .  <eos>   i went in for three minutes , and was detained by miss bates ' s being absent .  <eos>   while he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going -- her father began his inquiries .  <eos>   his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment ; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own .  <eos>   a man does not imagine any such thing .  <eos>   and , by what i understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable .  <eos>   this is delightful , is not it ?-- where ' s dear mr .  <eos>   " that is ," replied mr . knightley , " she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all .  <eos>   i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him ; he sent in letters , but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth .  <eos>   do you know how miss bates and her niece came here ?"  <eos>   she thought he was often looking at her , and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give .  <eos>   impossible !"  <eos>   such a heart is very little worth having ; is it , lady russell ?  <eos>   to complete every other recommendation , he had _almost_ told her that he loved her .  <eos>   she will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home .  <eos>   but it should be so no more .  <eos>   " so very kind !"  <eos>   while he staid , the martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again , emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return elizabeth martin ' s visit .  <eos>   it will not do to _invite_ five couple .  <eos>   on their first coming into the country , they had lived in proportion to their income , quietly , keeping little company , and that little unexpensively ; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means -- the house in town had yielded greater profits , and fortune in general had smiled on them .  <eos>   they did not like each other , and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good ; and were lady russell to see them together , she might think that he had too much self - possession , and she too little .  <eos>   they sang together once more ; and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own .  <eos>   colonel campbell rather preferred an olive .  <eos>   " you are comfortable because you are under command ."  <eos>   " must i go first ?  <eos>   the young man ' s conduct , and his sister ' s , seemed the result of real feeling , and she could not but pity them .  <eos>   let me recommend bath to you .  <eos>   her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkins ' s happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached !-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love !  <eos>   one perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain .  <eos>   if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it ;-- and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can ;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man ' s house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow .  <eos>   " but why should you be sorry , sir ?-- i assure you , it did the children a great deal of good ."  <eos>   " had not she better be carried to the inn ?  <eos>   mrs . weston ' s communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax .  <eos>   she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business ; felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought ; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active , respectable young man , as a resident curate , and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate ' s being married .  <eos>   she wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into mr . and mrs . weston ' s disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship .  <eos>   " and not known to him , perhaps , so soon ."  <eos>   ah !  <eos>   how anne ' s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence .  <eos>   emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and mr . elton warmly added ,  <eos>   one morning , about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth being gone a - shooting together , as the sisters in the cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the mansion - house .  <eos>   it did not often happen ; for mr . john knightley had really a great regard for his father - in - law , and generally a strong sense of what was due to him ; but it was too often for emma ' s charity , especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured , though the offence came not .  <eos>   the whole party walked about , and looked , and praised again ; and then , having nothing else to do , formed a sort of half - circle round the fire , to observe in their various modes , till other subjects were started , that , though _may_ , a fire in the evening was still very pleasant .  <eos>   elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally .  <eos>   i must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me .  <eos>   " there does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present ," said mrs . weston , " as can well be ; and while she is so happy at hartfield , i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr . woodhouse ' s account .  <eos>   nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there .  <eos>   yours affectionately ,  <eos>   he will find an _addition_ to the society of highbury when he comes again ; that is , if i may presume to call myself an addition .  <eos>   he might be able to join them in the evening , but certainly not to dinner .  <eos>   she always takes the right time for applying .  <eos>   i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr . frank churchill , who is like nobody by his side .  <eos>   she was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious !  <eos>   i could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult ., as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects , i should not have presumed on such early measures , but from the very particular circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose .  <eos>   many a noble fortune has been made during the war .  <eos>   she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait .  <eos>   there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe before " mr . elton and his bride " was in every body ' s mouth , and frank churchill was forgotten .  <eos>   it is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at maple grove and in bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice .  <eos>   " the old lady !  <eos>   " so scrupulous for others ," he continued , " and yet so careless for herself !  <eos>   mrs . weston wants to see you .  <eos>   it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood .  <eos>   " as you do us such ample justice now ," said emma , laughing , " i will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ?  <eos>   skilful has been the hand !"  <eos>   and here i can admit , that my manners to miss w ., in being unpleasant to miss f ., were highly blameable .  <eos>   we shall certainly take that post ."  <eos>   they met mr . martin the very next day , as they were walking on the donwell road .  <eos>   she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable .  <eos>   i am quite determined to refuse him .  <eos>   but , anne , only conceive how extraordinary !  <eos>   he started .  <eos>   " i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy ," said mr . knightley presently , " though i have kept my thoughts to myself ; but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet .  <eos>   i shall have no fears for you with him .  <eos>   " we are expecting a brother of mrs croft ' s here soon ; i dare say you know him by name ."  <eos>   she had no child to connect her with life and happiness again , no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs , no health to make all the rest supportable .  <eos>   mrs . weston remained with mr . woodhouse .  <eos>   it is so much beyond any thing i deserve .  <eos>   a considerable journey ."  <eos>   " don ' t class us together , harriet .  <eos>   she believed every body spoke well of him .  <eos>   " did he appear a sensible young man ; a young man of information ?"  <eos>   but in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs .  <eos>   like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her .  <eos>   alas !  <eos>   i can have no self - command without a motive .  <eos>   " if it would be good to her , i am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion .  <eos>   it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that " of course it must be declined ," she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful .  <eos>   " i rather hope to satisfy you both ," said emma , " for i shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic ."  <eos>   we were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now .-- he is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity .  <eos>   no , indeed , miss woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; i can sit and admire him now without any great misery .  <eos>   " it was her very particular friend , you know ."  <eos>   the time of year lightened the evil to him .  <eos>   " nonsense !  <eos>   emma laughed , and replied ,  <eos>   michaelmas came ; and now anne ' s heart must be in kellynch again .  <eos>   living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and colonel campbell ' s residence being in london , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters .  <eos>   chapter iv  <eos>   when he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her .  <eos>   you amuse me excessively .  <eos>   emma , you are a great dreamer , i think ?"  <eos>   he came back gay and self - satisfied , eager and busy , caring nothing for miss woodhouse , and defying miss smith .  <eos>   i think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little .  <eos>   have not i some right to complain ?  <eos>   there probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference ; mr . dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to miss campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds .  <eos>   i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him ."  <eos>   i need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to miss smith !-- no , madam , my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement i received --"  <eos>   i have taken some pains for your sake , and for robert martin ' s sake , ( whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever ,) to get acquainted with her .  <eos>   " nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know ."  <eos>   what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding - cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body ' s eating it .  <eos>   i have known a good deal of the profession ; and besides their liberality , they are so neat and careful in all their ways !  <eos>   he almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do ."  <eos>   this , harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us ."  <eos>   it is to be a morning scheme , you know , knightley ; quite a simple thing .  <eos>   you are too bountiful !  <eos>   yet she could not bear this silence .  <eos>   three months , she says so , positively , as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you .  <eos>   you like mr . elton , papa ,-- i must look about for a wife for him .  <eos>   it was settled that they should go to box hill .  <eos>   she had no objection .  <eos>   after some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank mrs . weston , look sorrowful , and have done .  <eos>   a dinner there must be .  <eos>   i shall certainly go ; i am sure i ought if i can , quite as much as charles , for they want me excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth , and i know you do not mind being left alone .  <eos>   it will not be so great a loss of time : but if you dislike it --"  <eos>   are you in any doubt as to that ?  <eos>   " very well .  <eos>   time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle -- but that is not the change i had in view for you .  <eos>   she must have been a perpetual enemy .  <eos>   " i think , harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr . martin .  <eos>   " no -- i shall not stir .  <eos>   " well , and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl , and what were we to wait for besides ?  <eos>   " i think , harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr . martin .  <eos>   then , said i , i must run across , i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party , she cannot refuse .--` aye , pray do ,' said mr . frank churchill , ` miss woodhouse ' s opinion of the instrument will be worth having .'  <eos>   i assure you , captain wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you ."  <eos>   i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description .  <eos>   she must not appear to think it a misfortune .-- with all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and mr . knightley meant to marry ; by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person ' s company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and mrs . weston , best in the world .  <eos>   nobody else would come so early .'  <eos>   " here comes this dear old beau of mine , i protest !-- only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men !-- what a dear creature he is ;-- i assure you i like him excessively .  <eos>   a very successful visit :-- i saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint .  <eos>   you see how delightfully she writes .  <eos>   " i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of .-- oh !  <eos>   to you -- to my two daughters -- i may venture on the truth .  <eos>   he has passed you very often ."  <eos>   she could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly .  <eos>   do not distress her ."  <eos>   quite a surprize to me !  <eos>   mr . knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade .  <eos>   i must confess it is a recommendation to me .  <eos>   who could have seen through such thick - headed nonsense ?  <eos>   there probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference ; mr . dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to miss campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds .  <eos>   my cousin anne shakes her head .  <eos>   i speak as a friend , emma .  <eos>   -- she thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully ; and the first possible cause for it , suggested by her fears , was , that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother , and was pained by the manner in which they had been received .  <eos>   knightley ."  <eos>   i really could not help exclaiming !  <eos>   i hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy .  <eos>   but , fair or not fair , there are unbecoming conjunctions , which reason will patronize in vain -- which taste cannot tolerate -- which ridicule will seize .  <eos>   was this like wishing to avoid her ?  <eos>   she laughed because she was disappointed ; and though she liked him for his attentions , and thought them all , whether in friendship , admiration , or playfulness , extremely judicious , they were not winning back her heart .  <eos>   we have had a very dull christmas ; mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays .  <eos>   she promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it .  <eos>   he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte , and turning to emma , said ,  <eos>   said anne .  <eos>   we shall never forget what you did ."  <eos>   emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr . knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked .  <eos>   the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have i now ) that there would be a general cry - out upon her extreme good luck .  <eos>   " donwell !"  <eos>   " walter ," said she , " get down this moment .  <eos>   it will be some trial to us both ."  <eos>   mrs musgrove was of a comfortable , substantial size , infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour , than tenderness and sentiment ; and while the agitations of anne ' s slender form , and pensive face , may be considered as very completely screened , captain wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self - command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son , whom alive nobody had cared for .  <eos>   he stopped in his earnestness to look the question , and the expression of his eyes overpowered her .  <eos>   they went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times .  <eos>   there had been the charm .  <eos>   convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield .  <eos>   " i would not go away without seeing you , but i have no time to spare , and therefore must now be gone directly .  <eos>   could he have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at parting would have been different .-- still , however , i must be on my guard .  <eos>   he had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but emma ' s feelings were chiefly with jane , in the argument ; and on leaving randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of mr . knightley ' s high superiority of character .  <eos>   oh no !  <eos>   " not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth .  <eos>   " i wish we could contrive it ," said she ; " but i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in ;-- no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father ."  <eos>   i shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when i return , i shall come to you for my wife .  <eos>   the whole party walked about , and looked , and praised again ; and then , having nothing else to do , formed a sort of half - circle round the fire , to observe in their various modes , till other subjects were started , that , though _may_ , a fire in the evening was still very pleasant .  <eos>   they were a couple worth looking at .  <eos>   harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account .  <eos>   his father very much wished him to meet captain wentworth , and there being no sufficient reason against it , he ought to go ; and it ended in his making a bold , public declaration , when he came in from shooting , of his meaning to dress directly , and dine at the other house .  <eos>   how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character , age , and situation ?-- emma , i had not thought it possible ."  <eos>   such a heart is very little worth having ; is it , lady russell ?  <eos>   a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her ."  <eos>   but poor mrs . bates had a bad cold about a month ago ."  <eos>   ` i did not make the allowances ,' said she , ` which i ought to have done , for his temper and spirits -- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , i am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first .'  <eos>   he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout , and mrs croft seemed to go shares with him in everything , and to walk for her life to do him good .  <eos>   they were alike too , in a general benevolence of temper , and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance .  <eos>   the scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; mrs . weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into highbury ;-- to hartfield of course .  <eos>   i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it .  <eos>   what were nine miles to a young man ?-- an hour ' s ride .  <eos>   such delightful proofs of hartfield ' s attraction , as those sort of visits conveyed , might shortly be over .  <eos>   the misfortune of harriet ' s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival .  <eos>   many a noble fortune has been made during the war .  <eos>   does mrs . churchill do the same ?"  <eos>   eight years , almost eight years had passed , since all had been given up .  <eos>   william larkins is such an old acquaintance !  <eos>   replied emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether harriet could indeed have received any hint .  <eos>   emma , finding her so determined upon neglecting her music , had nothing more to say ; and , after a moment ' s pause , mrs . elton chose another subject .  <eos>   she had much to recover from , before she could move .  <eos>   mrs . elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all .  <eos>   i shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball , if not for frank churchill ; but mr . knightley will be happy .  <eos>   he sat down with them , and improved their conversation very much .  <eos>   " my advice ," said mrs . weston kindly and persuasively , " i certainly do feel tempted to give .  <eos>   but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling -- there was one person , i think , who must have felt it : miss fairfax herself .  <eos>   if i had not promoted mr . weston ' s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all .  <eos>   to isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her father ' s account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at randalls .  <eos>   has perry seen her ?  <eos>   i told you that your suspicions would guide mine ."  <eos>   she had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush .  <eos>   my dear sir , you really are too bountiful .  <eos>   do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye -- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ?"  <eos>   lady russell was fond of bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend ' s health , by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good .  <eos>   no -- far from it -- certainly plain .  <eos>   her countenance , perhaps , might express some watchfulness ; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister .  <eos>   said sir walter , in the height of his good humour .  <eos>   captain benwick must give up his room to them , and get another bed elsewhere ; and the whole was settled .  <eos>   there was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend ' s .  <eos>   " one ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but enscombe , i believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _she_ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her ."  <eos>   he had seen mrs croft , too ; she was at taunton with the admiral , and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over .  <eos>   it was very lucky , for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account ; and i am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; i have a great opinion of her .  <eos>   always my kindest friend on every occasion .  <eos>   the kind - hearted , polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty , and made every fair lady welcome and easy .  <eos>   the room at the crown was to witness it ;-- but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd .  <eos>   she was immediately up , and wanting to quit the table ; but so many were also moving , that she could not get away ; and mr . knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept away by her unexamined .  <eos>   am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smith ?-- that you have never thought seriously of her ?"  <eos>   chapter vii  <eos>   it had been a frosty morning , to be sure , a sharp frost , which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of .  <eos>   very well done indeed !  <eos>   i will bring friends with me ."  <eos>   tell me how miss fairfax is ."  <eos>   the thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , jane , miss bates , and me -- and my caro sposo walking by .  <eos>   in all other respects , her visit began and proceeded very well .  <eos>   miss harville only died last june .  <eos>   from harriet ' s happening not to be at hartfield , and her father ' s being present to engage mr . elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady ' s conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that mrs . elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do mr . elton no good .  <eos>   elizabeth , may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place ?"  <eos>   " yes , yes , to the inn ," repeated captain wentworth , comparatively collected , and eager to be doing something .  <eos>   have you finished it ?  <eos>   mrs . elton ' s resources were inadequate to such an attack .  <eos>   " i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing .  <eos>   you appear to me a little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to - morrow will bring , i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to - night ."  <eos>   emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly .  <eos>   " do you know miss bates ' s niece ?  <eos>   " it is very natural .  <eos>   " i am glad you approve of what i have done ," said he very comfortably .  <eos>   the sea is no beautifier , certainly ; sailors do grow old betimes ; i have observed it ; they soon lose the look of youth .  <eos>   could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied .-- let him but continue the same mr . knightley to her and her father , the same mr . knightley to all the world ; let donwell and hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured .-- marriage , in fact , would not do for her .  <eos>   they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter .  <eos>   there were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer .  <eos>   " this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir .  <eos>   ` three things very dull indeed .'  <eos>   i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell ."  <eos>   then the baked apples came home , mrs . wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the wallises , always -- i have heard some people say that mrs . wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them .  <eos>   isabella and emma , i think , do write very much alike .  <eos>   there were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer .  <eos>   she hoped , on turning her head , to see the master of the house ; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy -- charles hayter , probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne .  <eos>   how peculiarly unprepared i was !-- for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before ."  <eos>   -- harriet ' s was --  <eos>   every feeling was offended ; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr . weston ' s temper .  <eos>   " nobody ever did think well of the churchills , i fancy ," observed mr . john knightley coolly .  <eos>   he was delighted with every thing ; admired hartfield sufficiently for mr . woodhouse ' s ear ; and when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village , and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma could have supposed .  <eos>   at the time of the ballroom ' s being built , suppers had not been in question ; and a small card - room adjoining , was the only addition .  <eos>   cried the good - hearted mrs . john knightley .  <eos>   emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off .  <eos>   " no , sir ," cried emma , " it confesses no such thing .  <eos>   " this is a pleasure ," said he , in rather a low voice , " coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated .  <eos>   mrs charles musgrove will , of course , wish to get back to her children ; but if anne will stay , no one so proper , so capable as anne ."  <eos>   ah !  <eos>   at first , while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver , i saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world .  <eos>   i will not say quite all .  <eos>   the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions .  <eos>   chapter xiii  <eos>   jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state .  <eos>   what are we to do ?-- the year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done .  <eos>   when she could let her attention take its natural course again , she found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list ( their own navy list , the first that had ever been at uppercross ), and sitting down together to pore over it , with the professed view of finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded .  <eos>   my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room .  <eos>   for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am , and as i am ."  <eos>   my regard for hartfield is most warm "--  <eos>   the youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope .  <eos>   no , my love ; but you will soon be tired .  <eos>   sir frederick and lady wentworth !  <eos>   it may be possible to do without dancing entirely .  <eos>   i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but i hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners ."  <eos>   i hope it does him some service with you ."  <eos>   " i declare , i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction !-- it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument .  <eos>   " well , miss woodhouse !"  <eos>   miss woodhouse , what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book !  <eos>   " you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates ," said emma .  <eos>   but still , there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath ; and as for the men !  <eos>   he knew her illnesses ; they never occurred but for her own convenience .  <eos>   i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married .  <eos>   she had weathered it , however , and could truly say that it had done her good .  <eos>   you and i must positively exert our authority ."  <eos>   what do you think of him ?  <eos>   he had frequently observed , as he walked , that one handsome face would be followed by thirty , or five - and - thirty frights ; and once , as he had stood in a shop on bond street , he had counted eighty - seven women go by , one after another , without there being a tolerable face among them .  <eos>   by only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice .  <eos>   it would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- i do not know that -- i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well ."  <eos>   he did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day .  <eos>   emma hoped it must rapidly work harriet ' s cure ; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much .-- it was not to be doubted that poor harriet ' s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve , and her own share in the story , under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him , had in all likelihood been given also .  <eos>   emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first .  <eos>   " and i am quite serious too , i assure you ," replied mrs . elton gaily , " in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us ."  <eos>   these valuable pictures of yours , sir walter , if you chose to leave them , would be perfectly safe .  <eos>   " a house of her own !-- but where is the advantage of a house of her own ?  <eos>   mr . knightley , why do not you stay at home like poor mr .  <eos>   if _we_ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations .  <eos>   " i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn , instead of coming here ."  <eos>   yes "-- he replied ; " i was just going to mention it .  <eos>   it ought to be a first object , as i am sure poor miss taylor ' s always was with me .  <eos>   poor girl !  <eos>   lord bless me !  <eos>   his manner had no air of study or exaggeration .  <eos>   with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told .  <eos>   harriet was too much agitated to encounter him .  <eos>   how improperly had she been acting by harriet !  <eos>   miss carteret , with still less to say , was so plain and so awkward , that she would never have been tolerated in camden place but for her birth .  <eos>   it was her superior duty .  <eos>   anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different .  <eos>   " that ' s right , my dear , very right .  <eos>   and jane declares -- well !--( as soon as she was within the door ) well !  <eos>   such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs . weston .  <eos>   he had , very soon after their engagement ceased , got employ : and all that he had told her would follow , had taken place .  <eos>   i do not believe i did you any good .  <eos>   we copied it from the elegant extracts .  <eos>   at first , if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened ; that there had been matches of greater disparity ( those were your very words );-- i should not have dared to give way to -- i should not have thought it possible -- but if _you_ , who had been always acquainted with him --"  <eos>   one says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning .  <eos>   she inherits her mother ' s talents , and must have been under subjection to her ."  <eos>   " dear me !  <eos>   how the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep !  <eos>   this was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the great house at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages , mr musgrove ' s coach containing the four ladies , and charles ' s curricle , in which he drove captain wentworth , were descending the long hill into lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone .  <eos>   " might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it !  <eos>   five couple are nothing , when one thinks seriously about it .  <eos>   his extreme attention to my mother -- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know -- it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick .  <eos>   she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr . elton .  <eos>   she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable .  <eos>   that is _court_ .  <eos>   she was actually forced to exert herself to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her .  <eos>   emma must submit to stand second to mrs . elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .  <eos>   but you were humble .  <eos>   they all united ; and , on reaching hartfield gates , emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him .  <eos>   and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her .  <eos>   after a mutual silence of some minutes , harriet thus began again --  <eos>   " he would be a very lucky man , shepherd ," replied sir walter ; " that ' s all i have to remark .  <eos>   she hoped , on turning her head , to see the master of the house ; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy -- charles hayter , probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne .  <eos>   " just as it should be ," said mr . john knightley , " and just as i hoped it was from your letters .  <eos>   " and a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be ," continued he ; " asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , sir walter , i found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford .  <eos>   i only want to know that mr . martin is not very , very bitterly disappointed ."  <eos>   " yes ," said mrs smith more doubtingly , " sometimes it may , though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe .  <eos>   her voice was not unsteady ; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self , such a burst of threatening evil , such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions , must create .-- she listened with much inward suffering , but with great outward patience , to harriet ' s detail .-- methodical , or well arranged , or very well delivered , it could not be expected to be ; but it contained , when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration , a substance to sink her spirit -- especially with the corroborating circumstances , which her own memory brought in favour of mr . knightley ' s most improved opinion of harriet .  <eos>   if colonel campbell is not the person , who can be ?"  <eos>   some laughed , and answered good - humouredly .  <eos>   leave shame to her .  <eos>   she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business ; felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought ; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active , respectable young man , as a resident curate , and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate ' s being married .  <eos>   he was not only to quit his home , but to see it in the hands of others ; a trial of fortitude , which stronger heads than sir walter ' s have found too much .  <eos>   a pleasant " thank you " seemed meant to laugh it off , but a blush , a quivering lip , a tear in the eye , shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh .  <eos>   she hoped it was not so .  <eos>   " my dear miss fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for .-- i hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well .  <eos>   -- even mr . weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said , " ah !  <eos>   it was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently ; and it did not surprise her , therefore , that lady russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent , nothing to require more motives than appeared , in mr elliot ' s great desire of a reconciliation .  <eos>   now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but i cannot stay to hear it ."  <eos>   and , without love , i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine .  <eos>   " time , my dearest emma , time will heal the wound .-- your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your father ' s sake -- i know you will not allow yourself --."  <eos>   when she became sensible of this , it struck her that she could not be very much in love ; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father , never to marry , a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings .  <eos>   who cried most ?"  <eos>   mrs . weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing .  <eos>   when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house ."  <eos>   very sincerely did emma wish to do so ; but it was not immediately in her power .  <eos>   " no , indeed -- _we_ are not at all in a bad air .  <eos>   cried his wife .--" my dear mr . e ., you have not been to donwell !-- you mean the crown ; you come from the meeting at the crown ."  <eos>   she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments .  <eos>   the day came , the party were punctually assembled , and mr . john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable .  <eos>   at this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emma ' s brain with regard to jane fairfax , this charming mr . dixon , and the not going to ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery ,  <eos>   they knew he was to dine in lansdown crescent .  <eos>   she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , miss woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her .  <eos>   though neither henrietta , nor louisa , nor charles hayter , nor captain wentworth were there , the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in .  <eos>   his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved .  <eos>   she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well .  <eos>   i hope he will be calling soon .  <eos>   but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma .  <eos>   soon afterwards he began again ,  <eos>   " she is a riddle , quite a riddle !"  <eos>   " have you heard from miss fairfax so lately ?  <eos>   " a sore - throat !-- i hope not infectious .  <eos>   it was mere lively chat , such as any young persons , on an intimate footing , might fall into .  <eos>   and , by the bye , can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion ?-- pray be sincere , knightley .  <eos>   " i must not dwell upon it ," said she .--" i must not think of it .  <eos>   the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant , " men never know when things are dirty or not ;" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself , " women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares ."  <eos>   she was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers .  <eos>   where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was .  <eos>   i have been always telling you , my love , that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have emma ' s account , i hope you will be satisfied ."  <eos>   that was the wind - up of the history ; that was the glory of miss hawkins .  <eos>   the intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger .  <eos>   you know we have settled all that already .  <eos>   he would gain cheerfulness , and she would learn to be an enthusiast for scott and lord byron ; nay , that was probably learnt already ; of course they had fallen in love over poetry .  <eos>   charles , henrietta , and captain wentworth were the three in consultation , and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror .  <eos>   i know what it is , for mr musgrove always attends the assizes , and i am so glad when they are over , and he is safe back again ."  <eos>   if i loved a man , as she loves the admiral , i would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and i would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else ."  <eos>   chapter xii  <eos>   " a straightforward , open - hearted man like weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like miss taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns .  <eos>   he proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , i was convinced he could not do better .  <eos>   " and i do envy him , emma .  <eos>   i met him just now .  <eos>   she believed every body found his manners pleasing ."  <eos>   they combated the point some time longer in the same way ; emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend ; for mrs . weston was the most used of the two to yield ; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over , and the instrument in preparation ;-- and at the same moment mr . cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it .  <eos>   it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves ; and this second meeting , short as it was , also proved again by the gentleman ' s looks , that he thought hers very lovely , and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies , that he was a man of exceedingly good manners .  <eos>   i never saw such a likeness in my life .  <eos>   it did not appear to me that -- in short , you know , dr shirley must have a curate , and you had secured his promise .  <eos>   i always take the part of my own sex .  <eos>   " prejudiced !  <eos>   mr . woodhouse could never allow for mr . knightley ' s claims on his brother , or any body ' s claims on isabella , except his own .  <eos>   " i do not know what your opinion may be , mrs . weston ," said mr . knightley , " of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith , but i think it a bad thing ."  <eos>   he hesitated , got up , walked to a window .  <eos>   oh !-- you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for mr . weston has told me himself .  <eos>   after a mutual silence of some minutes , harriet thus began again --  <eos>   if i come , i shall be cross ."  <eos>   the picture !-- how eager he had been about the picture !-- and the charade !-- and an hundred other circumstances ;-- how clearly they had seemed to point at harriet .  <eos>   " i am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but i assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere , i am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming .  <eos>   " till i have a letter from colonel campbell ," said she , in a voice of forced calmness , " i can imagine nothing with any confidence .  <eos>   elton ' s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired .  <eos>   the evil of a marriage would be much diminished , if elizabeth were also to marry .  <eos>   her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected .  <eos>   i never saw mrs . weston better in my life -- never looking so well .  <eos>   there was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party ; and he was very much questioned , and especially by the two miss musgroves , who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him , as to the manner of living on board , daily regulations , food , hours , & c ., and their surprise at his accounts , at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable , drew from him some pleasant ridicule , which reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant , and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat , or any cook to dress it if there were , or any servant to wait , or any knife and fork to use .  <eos>   i have never been attached to him .  <eos>   good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice .  <eos>   he did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused ."  <eos>   every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea , and in a moment ( it was all done in rapid moments ) captain benwick had resigned the poor corpse - like figure entirely to the brother ' s care , and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity .  <eos>   " especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature !"  <eos>   this is saying very plainly --` pray , miss smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you .  <eos>   " what does all that signify ?  <eos>   a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities , or neither .  <eos>   my dearest anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life !"  <eos>   elton .-- this letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on mrs . churchill ' s account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks enscombe too cold for her -- so they are all to move southward without loss of time ."  <eos>   jane came back delighted yesterday .  <eos>   no , mr . knightley , do not foretell vexation from that quarter ."  <eos>   " i do think it is , without exception , the best charade i ever read ."  <eos>   we talked it all over with mr . weston last night .  <eos>   " no , indeed you are mistaken ."  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   to look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation .  <eos>   i hope he will not mind it so very much ."  <eos>   anne , judging from her own temperament , would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves , which louisa ' s illness must have so greatly shaken .  <eos>   three months , she says so , positively , as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you .  <eos>   she could not call herself an invalid now , compared with her state on first reaching bath .  <eos>   " i hope you will bring elton ," said he : " but i will not trouble you to give any other invitations ."  <eos>   emma ' s answer was ready at the first word .  <eos>   mrs . cole had many to agree with her ; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell , and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made ; and there were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way , and still listen to mrs . cole .  <eos>   mrs . weston could only approve .  <eos>   " i never want them , i assure you .  <eos>   " what sort of looking man is mr .  <eos>   and once henry asked me for a knife , but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas .  <eos>   " no , my dear ," said her father instantly ; " _that_ i am sure you are not .  <eos>   i am always glad to see him .  <eos>   " poor girl !"  <eos>   she was not sorry for the excuse .  <eos>   the aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and jane ' s offences rose again .  <eos>   lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all , wondered , grieved , and feared ; and the affront it contained to anne , in mrs clay ' s being of so much use , while anne could be of none , was a very sore aggravation .  <eos>   .  <eos>   but i cannot believe it of you .  <eos>   emma pondered a moment , and then replied , " i will not pretend _not_ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of ."  <eos>   the result of his reverie was , " no , emma , i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize .-- i never had a thought of her in that way , i assure you ."  <eos>   " these would have been all my friends ," was her thought ; and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness .  <eos>   cried sir walter .  <eos>   they would hardly come in their chaise , i think , at that season of the year .  <eos>   she knew a family near maple grove who had tried it , and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter .  <eos>   you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies -- quite a horror of them .  <eos>   now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus -- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned !-- well , this is brilliant !  <eos>   a mrs smith .  <eos>   " you have heard of a certain frank churchill , i presume ," he continued -- " and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name ."  <eos>   and i am not only , not going to be married , at present , but have very little intention of ever marrying at all ."  <eos>   it was all right , all open , all equal .  <eos>   he saw no fault in the room , he would acknowledge none which they suggested .  <eos>   elton ?"  <eos>   " you are prepared for the worst , i see -- and very bad it is .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   whenever she is with us , mrs . cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can .  <eos>   on going down to breakfast the next morning , she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady ' s side of meaning to leave them .  <eos>   then , if you please , you shall send it all to mrs . goddard ' s -- i do not know -- no , i think , miss woodhouse , i may just as well have it sent to hartfield , and take it home with me at night .  <eos>   you had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as i cannot be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine ."  <eos>   there is no hurry at all .  <eos>   not unfrequently , through emma ' s persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card - table for him .  <eos>   they , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed .  <eos>   said i to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( sir basil morley ).  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   no , i could not endure william coxe -- a pert young lawyer ."  <eos>   she knew herself to be of the first utility to the child ; and what was it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant , making himself agreeable to others ?  <eos>   miss campbell always was absolutely plain -- but extremely elegant and amiable ."  <eos>   poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them !"  <eos>   when it came to such a pitch as this , she was not able to refrain from a start , or a heavy sigh , or even from walking about the room for a few seconds -- and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn , was in the resolution of her own better conduct , and the hope that , however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past , it would yet find her more rational , more acquainted with herself , and leave her less to regret when it were gone .  <eos>   only my pattern gown is at hartfield .  <eos>   do help me .  <eos>   continued mrs . elton ; " knightley himself !-- was not it lucky ?-- for , not being within when he called the other day , i had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of mr . e .' s , i had a great curiosity .  <eos>   in one point she was fully justified .  <eos>   " but i thought you would .  <eos>   by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make , admiral croft was a native of somersetshire , who having acquired a very handsome fortune , was wishing to settle in his own country , and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood , which , however , had not suited him ; that accidentally hearing --( it was just as he had foretold , mr shepherd observed , sir walter ' s concerns could not be kept a secret ,)-- accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let , and understanding his ( mr shepherd ' s ) connection with the owner , he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries , and had , in the course of a pretty long conference , expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel ; and given mr shepherd , in his explicit account of himself , every proof of his being a most responsible , eligible tenant .  <eos>   henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father .  <eos>   there was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for mr . weston immediately accosted her with ,  <eos>   my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place .  <eos>   this does not seem much like joy , indeed , in me --( twinkling away a tear or two )-- but it will be very trying for us to part with her , after having had her so long , and she has a dreadful headache just now , writing all the morning :-- such long letters , you know , to be written to colonel campbell , and mrs . dixon .  <eos>   she watched him well .  <eos>   it was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue .  <eos>   the disgrace of his first marriage might , perhaps , as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring , have been got over , had he not done worse ; but he had , as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends , they had been informed , spoken most disrespectfully of them all , most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to , and the honours which were hereafter to be his own .  <eos>   there can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both occasionally thinking of captain benwick , from this time .  <eos>   i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways .  <eos>   i am always well , you know .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   what has mr . frank churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ?"  <eos>   were he ever able to get away , the day would be spent in coming and returning .  <eos>   chapter iii  <eos>   " yes ; if you and mr . woodhouse see no objection , and i trust you cannot , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there .  <eos>   she would not take a denial .  <eos>   goddard ' s ."  <eos>   presently mr . knightley looked back , and came and sat down by her .  <eos>   " my brother ," whispered one of the girls ; " mamma is thinking of poor richard ."  <eos>   " mrs musgrove thinks all her servants so steady , that it would be high treason to call it in question ; but i am sure , without exaggeration , that her upper house - maid and laundry - maid , instead of being in their business , are gadding about the village , all day long .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   i always take the part of my own sex .  <eos>   " i am afraid ," said he , composing his features , " i am very much afraid , my dear emma , that you will not smile when you hear it ."  <eos>   how could she have been so brutal , so cruel to miss bates !  <eos>   miss hamilton , now mrs smith , had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable .  <eos>   between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters .  <eos>   " let me entreat you ," cried mr . elton ; " it would indeed be a delight !  <eos>   " the worst is over !"  <eos>   we are so very airy !  <eos>   " you could not have visited me !"  <eos>   no -- what an impudent dog i was !-- how could i dare --"  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   i saw her as i came in ; she was standing in the entrance .  <eos>   " i am no match - maker , as you well know ," said lady russell , " being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations .  <eos>   emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr . weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass .  <eos>   " let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed ," cried emma .  <eos>   she was sorry , very sorry .  <eos>   weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort , or his son may plague him ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , mr . knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus --  <eos>   " might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ?"  <eos>   " a man cannot be more so ," was his short , full answer .  <eos>   the want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied .  <eos>   were you , yourself , ever to marry , she is the very woman for you .  <eos>   we are not asked to dine with them , however , till the day after , mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey , which is not very likely , considering the care that will be taken of her ; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to - morrow .  <eos>   we never heard of such things at maple grove ."  <eos>   this happened the night before last .  <eos>   no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all .-- a pretty fortune ; and she came in his way ."  <eos>   a letter from his friend , captain harville , having found him out at last , had brought intelligence of captain harville ' s being settled with his family at lyme for the winter ; of their being therefore , quite unknowingly , within twenty miles of each other .  <eos>   when shall i leave you again ?"  <eos>   mrs . weston proposed having no regular supper ; merely sandwiches , & c ., set out in the little room ; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion .  <eos>   where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ?  <eos>   there was so much of friendliness , and of flattery , and of everything most bewitching in his reception there ; the old were so hospitable , the young so agreeable , that he could not but resolve to remain where he was , and take all the charms and perfections of edward ' s wife upon credit a little longer .  <eos>   i planned the match from that hour ; and when such success has blessed me in this instance , dear papa , you cannot think that i shall leave off match - making ."  <eos>   it is not a connexion to gratify ; but if mr . churchill does not feel that , why should we ?  <eos>   a very few days had passed after this adventure , when harriet came one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began :  <eos>   when the campbells are returned , we shall meet them in london , and continue there , i trust , till we may carry her northward .-- but now , i am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard , miss woodhouse ?-- till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation .  <eos>   emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on harriet ' s side , not her own .  <eos>   they were not off the cobb , before the harvilles met them .  <eos>   ` my dear ,' said i , ` i shall say you are laid down upon the bed :' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room .  <eos>   she was out ; and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in .  <eos>   said she ; " that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you ."  <eos>   absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude .  <eos>   excellent fellow .  <eos>   her father ' s comfort was amply secured , mrs . bates as well as mrs . goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal .-- she had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it .  <eos>   ah !  <eos>   miss fairfax ' s recent illness had offered a fair plea for mrs . weston to invite her to an airing ; she had drawn back and declined at first , but , on being pressed had yielded ; and , in the course of their drive , mrs . weston had , by gentle encouragement , overcome so much of her embarrassment , as to bring her to converse on the important subject .  <eos>   their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross ; and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place , which had been taken , and her regret that mrs clay should still be with them , anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick , than her own father ' s house in camden place , or her own sister ' s intimacy with mrs clay .  <eos>   i thought -- but i beg your pardon , perhaps i have been under a mistake .  <eos>   mr . dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ?"  <eos>   for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken .  <eos>   the joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined .  <eos>   " or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument -- which must now be shut up in london , untouched by any body ."  <eos>   with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body ' s feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body ' s destiny .  <eos>   they seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers .  <eos>   and it will not be very long , i hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason .-- fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled !-- i could never , i confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt -- i could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which i never believed him to deserve .-- he is a disgrace to the name of man .-- and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman ?-- jane , jane , you will be a miserable creature ."  <eos>   there was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant for the ladies , and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower , and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight , excepting louisa ; she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth .  <eos>   she wished , however to see the crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned .  <eos>   to be sure , i may just as well go as not , for i am of no use at home -- am i ?  <eos>   " my dear emma ," said he , moving from his chair into one close by her , " you are not going to tell me , i hope , that you had not a pleasant evening ."  <eos>   my father depends on it .  <eos>   with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever .  <eos>   " but why should you be sorry , sir ?-- i assure you , it did the children a great deal of good ."  <eos>   how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ?  <eos>   and mrs .  <eos>   but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father ' s house ."  <eos>   she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate .  <eos>   highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking highbury , would be his constant attraction ."  <eos>   there was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend ' s .  <eos>   pain is no expiation .  <eos>   you must see the difference ."  <eos>   it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls , and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .  <eos>   well , ( smiling ,) i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important .  <eos>   it would have been strange if i had not gone ."  <eos>   and here i can admit , that my manners to miss w ., in being unpleasant to miss f ., were highly blameable .  <eos>   mr . weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning ' s work for her .  <eos>   mrs . goddard ' s school was in high repute -- and very deservedly ; for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands .  <eos>   and one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves , one of them after talking of rank , people of rank , and jealousy of rank , said , " i have no scruple of observing to you , how nonsensical some persons are about their place , because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it ; but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious , especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma .  <eos>   " i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse , which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember , and which at last , on some very wet day , is lent to yourself .  <eos>   one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry .  <eos>   she knew the ways of uppercross as well as those of kellynch .  <eos>   intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question .  <eos>   so very obliging of mr . frank churchill !  <eos>   there is no use in delay .  <eos>   she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment .-- such was the blood of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for !-- it was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for mr . knightley -- or for the churchills -- or even for mr .  <eos>   -- but ever since we had the history of that day , i have been so fond of mr .  <eos>   remember it ?  <eos>   " if i know myself , harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty .  <eos>   consider what you are about .  <eos>   he was not only pardoned , they were delighted with him .  <eos>   " but you , who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger , surely ?"  <eos>   every emendation of anne ' s had been on the side of honesty against importance .  <eos>   they separated too much into parties .  <eos>   knightley is quite the gentleman .  <eos>   what a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave !-- he gave his consent with very little persuasion ."  <eos>   " so they will , my dear .  <eos>   my dear miss woodhouse -- i come quite over - powered .  <eos>   weston and cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead .-- i fancy mr . e . and knightley have every thing their own way ."  <eos>   the intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another .  <eos>   so emma thought , at least .  <eos>   she had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , " much the same -- not better ."  <eos>   it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion , to foresee the smiles , the sneers , the merriment it would prompt at his expense ; the mortification and disdain of his brother , the thousand inconveniences to himself .-- could it be ?-- no ; it was impossible .  <eos>   should she proceed no farther ?-- should she let it pass , and seem to suspect nothing ?-- perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances , she was perfectly resolved .-- she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once , all that she meant to say and know .  <eos>   he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late .  <eos>   she was obliged to stop and think .  <eos>   he had frightened her a little about mr . elton ; but when she considered that mr . knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of mr . knightley ' s pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about .  <eos>   " i hope mrs . bates and miss fairfax are --"  <eos>   he had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after lady elliot ' s death , sir walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing - back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to london , when elizabeth was in her first bloom , mr elliot had been forced into the introduction .  <eos>   his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved .  <eos>   he spoke and looked so much in earnest , that anne was not surprised to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself .  <eos>   ` but ,' said i , ` to be quite honest , i do not think i can live without something of a musical society .  <eos>   " i see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention .  <eos>   woodhouse , who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined even by him , stirred no more ; and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that mrs . weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need .  <eos>   charles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin ' s behaviour .  <eos>   was this like wishing to avoid her ?  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   " it is not fair ," said emma , in a whisper ; " mine was a random guess .  <eos>   we are very proud of the children , are not we , papa ?  <eos>   mr . weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself .  <eos>   i do not pretend to it .  <eos>   very well ," exclaimed miss bates , " then i need not be uneasy .  <eos>   i beg your pardon , sir .  <eos>   you will laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word , i talk of nothing but jane fairfax .-- and her situation is so calculated to affect one !-- miss woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her .  <eos>   but do come in .  <eos>   weston ."  <eos>   though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after mr and mrs musgrove ' s going than anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to uppercross they drove over to the lodge .  <eos>   lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject , and gave it much serious consideration .  <eos>   she was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired .  <eos>   she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid .  <eos>   the park would be open to him of course , and few navy officers , or men of any other description , can have had such a range ; but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure - grounds , is another thing .  <eos>   they called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as i understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain .-- she made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving .  <eos>   said she .--" to chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort !  <eos>   and then , her reserve -- i never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved ."  <eos>   " yes , i made the best of it ; i always do : but i was very far from well at the time ; and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning : very unfit to be left alone , i am sure .  <eos>   but -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ), to marry him !-- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind !-- look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her !-- it was most provoking .  <eos>   she must see you ."  <eos>   nobody could nurse her , as we should do ."  <eos>   " most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty .  <eos>   emma watched them in , and then joined harriet at the interesting counter ,-- trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern .  <eos>   we were always glad to see him at hartfield ."  <eos>   i have not forgotten it , i assure you .-- deceived myself , i did very miserably deceive you -- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever .  <eos>   emma was more than half in hopes of mr . elton ' s having dropt a hint .  <eos>   " thank you , dear miss woodhouse , you are all kindness .-- it is impossible to say -- yes , indeed , i quite understand -- dearest jane ' s prospects -- that is , i do not mean .-- but she is charmingly recovered .-- how is mr .  <eos>   my only doubt is , whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish .  <eos>   " family connexions were always worth preserving , good company always worth seeking ; lady dalrymple had taken a house , for three months , in laura place , and would be living in style .  <eos>   are you in any doubt as to that ?  <eos>   her next beginning was ,  <eos>   miss bates said a great deal ; mrs . elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouse ' s presiding ; mr . knightley ' s answer was the most distinct .  <eos>   i am afraid of her , as i have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but i respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at uppercross ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   miss fairfax ' s recent illness had offered a fair plea for mrs . weston to invite her to an airing ; she had drawn back and declined at first , but , on being pressed had yielded ; and , in the course of their drive , mrs . weston had , by gentle encouragement , overcome so much of her embarrassment , as to bring her to converse on the important subject .  <eos>   he does not care about jane fairfax .  <eos>   but we never did .  <eos>   he was gone the next moment :-- after another moment ' s pause ,  <eos>   she had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late .  <eos>   " you cannot see too much perfection in mrs . weston for my feelings ," said emma ; " were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ , i should listen with pleasure ; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words .  <eos>   in one respect he is the object of my envy ."  <eos>   i feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that i shall soon be abroad .  <eos>   if mr . elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine harriet ' s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him .  <eos>   " well , i am so sorry !-- oh !  <eos>   it was now the middle of june , and the weather fine ; and mrs . elton was growing impatient to name the day , and settle with mr . weston as to pigeon - pies and cold lamb , when a lame carriage - horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty .  <eos>   said emma , recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement .  <eos>   cried the good - hearted mrs . john knightley .  <eos>   cried emma , putting her hand before her face , and jumping up , " you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear .  <eos>   she must abide by the evil of having refused him , whatever it may be ; and as to the refusal itself , i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little ; but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do .  <eos>   mr . knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence -- so shocked !-- jane and i are both so shocked about the apples !"  <eos>   she had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush .  <eos>   on their first coming into the country , they had lived in proportion to their income , quietly , keeping little company , and that little unexpensively ; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means -- the house in town had yielded greater profits , and fortune in general had smiled on them .  <eos>   look at her .  <eos>   two such she did not want .  <eos>   you are not striving to look taller than any body else .  <eos>   " _you_ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions .-- i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution .-- i wish i had attended to it -- but --( with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) i seem to have been doomed to blindness ."  <eos>   " my feelings , you see , did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth ."  <eos>   mr . churchill would never get over it ."  <eos>   the sea is no beautifier , certainly ; sailors do grow old betimes ; i have observed it ; they soon lose the look of youth .  <eos>   on tuesday night , he made a very awkward sort of excuse ; ` he never shot ' and he had ` been quite misunderstood ,' and he had promised this and he had promised that , and the end of it was , i found , that he did not mean to come .  <eos>   this is the simple truth ."  <eos>   " say nothing , my dear emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of mrs . elton .  <eos>   the symptoms were favourable .-- instead of answering , harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard .  <eos>   the idea of louisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste , and sentimental reflection was amusing , but she had no doubt of its being so .  <eos>   here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life ."  <eos>   she believed every body found his manners pleasing ."  <eos>   " how is your niece , miss bates ?-- i want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece .  <eos>   " whatever you say is always right ," cried harriet , " and therefore i suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise i could not have imagined it .  <eos>   she could think of nothing better : and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve -- something of ingratitude , merely glossed over -- it must be done , or what would become of harriet ?  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   that has been a very great improvement .  <eos>   and jane declares -- well !--( as soon as she was within the door ) well !  <eos>   i hope whenever poor isabella ' s little ones have the measles , she will send for perry ."  <eos>   harriet unfolded the parcel , and she looked on with impatience .  <eos>   he wishes exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him ."  <eos>   " very well ," replied emma ; " a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better i shall be pleased .  <eos>   " i do not know ; but i can hardly suppose that , at admiral croft ' s time of life , and in his profession , he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this ."  <eos>   ` have you , upon your honour ?'  <eos>   the bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by mrs . john knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them .  <eos>   she was safely down , and instantly , to show her enjoyment , ran up the steps to be jumped down again .  <eos>   " very soon , very soon , indeed ; that ' s the worst of it .  <eos>   emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort .  <eos>   anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house ; and louisa , by whom she found herself walking , burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy ; their friendliness , their brotherliness , their openness , their uprightness ; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england ; that they only knew how to live , and they only deserved to be respected and loved .  <eos>   but to be sure , in general they are so spoilt !  <eos>   and if he were to be lost to them for harriet ' s sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in harriet ' s society all that he wanted ; if harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing emma ' s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ?  <eos>   charles wonders what captain wentworth will say ; but if you remember , i never thought him attached to louisa ; i never could see anything of it .  <eos>   " three o ' clock yesterday !  <eos>   the impertinence of the eltons , which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening , had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of harriet ' s infatuation .-- from harriet ' s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she had strong hopes .  <eos>   she must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable .  <eos>   after a short struggle , however , charles hayter seemed to quit the field .  <eos>   " not at all ."  <eos>   but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield .  <eos>   " i hope i should know better ," he replied ; " no , depend upon it , ( with a gallant bow ,) that in addressing mrs . weston i should understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms ."  <eos>   the crofts must be in bath !  <eos>   " i am afraid ," said he , composing his features , " i am very much afraid , my dear emma , that you will not smile when you hear it ."  <eos>   i shall never forget his flying henry ' s kite for him that very windy day last easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o ' clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham , i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence .-- if any body can deserve him , it must be miss taylor ."  <eos>   as long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness :-- what must be at last , had better be soon .  <eos>   get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it ."  <eos>   it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due , and she must doubly feel the omission .  <eos>   i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with , who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece ."  <eos>   he was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys , clinging to him like an old friend , and declaring he should not go ; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets , & c ., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun , anne was left to persuade herself , as well as she could , that the same brother must still be in question .  <eos>   her character appeared absolutely changed .  <eos>   nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind ;-- and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her !-- it certainly was very extraordinary !-- and knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more .  <eos>   i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment .  <eos>   one morning , about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth being gone a - shooting together , as the sisters in the cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the mansion - house .  <eos>   i had no intention , i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes , when i first entered the house .  <eos>   harriet may pick and chuse .  <eos>   " i am disappointed ," was his only answer .  <eos>   she knows their ways best ; but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present .  <eos>   it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself , and without one real , rational difficulty to oppose or delay it .  <eos>   he had hoped she would speak again , but she did not .  <eos>   anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing ; but the age of emotion she certainly had not .  <eos>   " it is as long again as almost all we have had before ."  <eos>   mrs . churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there , and had otherwise a fancy for the place .  <eos>   wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing .  <eos>   but indeed i would much rather have it only in one .  <eos>   and on mrs musgrove ' s side , it was , " i make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter - in - law ' s concerns , for i know it would not do ; but i shall tell you , miss anne , because you may be able to set things to rights , that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles ' s nursery - maid : i hear strange stories of her ; she is always upon the gad ; and from my own knowledge , i can declare , she is such a fine - dressing lady , that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near .  <eos>   one morning , very soon after the dinner at the musgroves , at which anne had not been present , captain wentworth walked into the drawing - room at the cottage , where were only herself and the little invalid charles , who was lying on the sofa .  <eos>   she deserves a better fate ."  <eos>   no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland .  <eos>   she consulted , and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to sir walter .  <eos>   she thinks so little of her own beauty .  <eos>   the acquaintance at present had no charm for her .  <eos>   before the middle of the next day , he was at hartfield ; and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme .  <eos>   emma denied none of it aloud , and agreed to none of it in private .  <eos>   it was soon drawn , perforce another way .  <eos>   her curiosity was greatly excited .  <eos>   compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words --" i had not a spare moment on tuesday , as you know , for miss woodhouse ' s beautiful little friend .  <eos>   if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child , i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like .  <eos>   it is early ."  <eos>   he might observe that it was so .  <eos>   " my first enjoyment ," replied john knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , " will be to find myself safe at hartfield again ."  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome .  <eos>   well , sir , the time must come when you will be paid for all this , when you will have little labour and great enjoyment ."  <eos>   jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard miss bates saying , " well , my dear , i shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed , and i am sure you are ill enough ."  <eos>   he knows where a surgeon is to be found ."  <eos>   may its approval beam in that soft eye !  <eos>   her own spirits improved by change of place and subject , by being removed three miles from kellynch ; mary ' s ailments lessened by having a constant companion , and their daily intercourse with the other family , since there was neither superior affection , confidence , nor employment in the cottage , to be interrupted by it , was rather an advantage .  <eos>   cried emma , shaking her head .--" ah !  <eos>   poor old john , i have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty - seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed - ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints -- i must go and see him to - day ; and so will jane , i am sure , if she gets out at all .  <eos>   it was the very event to engage those who talk most , the young and the low ; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news .  <eos>   how could it be ?-- then i must have dreamt it -- but i was completely persuaded -- miss smith , you walk as if you were tired .  <eos>   dear miss woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ?"  <eos>   she could not stand it .  <eos>   i am sure , anne , if you would , you might persuade him that i really am very ill -- a great deal worse than i ever own ."  <eos>   now , an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter .  <eos>   poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them !"  <eos>   i assure you , captain wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you ."  <eos>   however , the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and i was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose .  <eos>   anne saw them wherever she went .  <eos>   she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction ."  <eos>   and so then , in my nonsense , i could not help making a treasure of it -- so i put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   he had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after lady elliot ' s death , sir walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing - back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to london , when elizabeth was in her first bloom , mr elliot had been forced into the introduction .  <eos>   " i am glad i have done being in love with him .  <eos>   at the same time , i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware .  <eos>   books of engravings , drawers of medals , cameos , corals , shells , and every other family collection within his cabinets , had been prepared for his old friend , to while away the morning ; and the kindness had perfectly answered .  <eos>   " it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected .  <eos>   a piece of paper was found on the table this morning --( dropt , we suppose , by a fairy )-- containing a very pretty charade , and we have just copied it in ."  <eos>   " yes , mr . dixon and miss campbell were the persons ; and i thought it a very strong proof ."  <eos>   i do not see it ."  <eos>   she would not let jane say , ` no ;' for when jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at donwell ,) when jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbell ' s return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told mrs . elton over and over again -- and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind !-- but that good mrs . elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than i did .  <eos>   " that may be -- but not by sketches in swisserland .  <eos>   while you were in the smallest degree wavering , i said nothing about it , because i would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me .  <eos>   churchill ."  <eos>   when he was here before , we made the best of it ; but there was a good deal of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always is in february , you know , and we could not do half that we intended .  <eos>   he shook his head ; but there was a smile of indulgence with it , and he only said ,  <eos>   " the laconia had come into plymouth the week before ; no danger of her being sent to sea again .  <eos>   by all their calculations there was just time for this ; but as they drew near the cobb , there was such a general wish to walk along it once more , all were so inclined , and louisa soon grew so determined , that the difference of a quarter of an hour , it was found , would be no difference at all ; so with all the kind leave - taking , and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined , they parted from captain and mrs harville at their own door , and still accompanied by captain benwick , who seemed to cling to them to the last , proceeded to make the proper adieus to the cobb .  <eos>   said sir walter .  <eos>   the tone implied some old acquaintance -- and how could she possibly guess ?  <eos>   " i did ," replied emma , " and they cannot forgive me ."  <eos>   one would fancy we were bosom friends !  <eos>   bless me !  <eos>   a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise -- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards .  <eos>   a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall ; and how they got their fortune nobody knows .  <eos>   .  <eos>   nature gave you understanding :-- miss taylor gave you principles .  <eos>   there was only harriet , who seemed not in spirits herself , fagged , and very willing to be silent ; and emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home , without being at any trouble to check them , extraordinary as they were .  <eos>   " i did not mean , i was not thinking of the slave - trade ," replied jane ; " governess - trade , i assure you , was all that i had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , i do not know where it lies .  <eos>   and so then , in my nonsense , i could not help making a treasure of it -- so i put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat ."  <eos>   can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me ?-- absurd and insufferable !"  <eos>   " dirty , sir !  <eos>   and upon looking over his letters and things , she found it was so , and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man , and her head is quite full of it , and of poor richard !  <eos>   she meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the abbey mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future .  <eos>   -- but , said i , i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me .--` oh ,' said he , ` wait half a minute , till i have finished my job ;'-- for , would you believe it , miss woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother ' s spectacles .-- the rivet came out , you know , this morning .-- so very obliging !-- for my mother had no use of her spectacles -- could not put them on .  <eos>   " how delighted i am to see you again !  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   but while so many were devoting him to emma , and emma herself making him over to harriet , mr . knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " and really , i do not think the impression will soon be over ," said emma , as she crossed the low hedge , and tottering footstep which ended the narrow , slippery path through the cottage garden , and brought them into the lane again .  <eos>   the young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on harriet ' s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own .  <eos>   and besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs . elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , mrs . elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to .  <eos>   in what respect ?  <eos>   emma woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .  <eos>   miss anne , if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son , i dare say he would have been just such another by this time ."  <eos>   shark is only one syllable .  <eos>   absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude .  <eos>   " a new neighbour for us all , miss woodhouse !"  <eos>   " the crofts have arrived in bath ?  <eos>   now will be the time .  <eos>   this made a difficulty .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   but i will shew her greater attention than i have done ."  <eos>   the answer was , " oh , no ; never ; she has quite given up dancing .  <eos>   they were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses , and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others ; but when the table was again safely covered , when every corner dish was placed exactly right , and occupation and ease were generally restored , emma said ,  <eos>   " very true , miss woodhouse , so she will .  <eos>   you are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it .  <eos>   this charade !-- if i had studied a twelvemonth , i could never have made any thing like it ."  <eos>   " not at all .  <eos>   we were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance ."  <eos>   yes , next week .  <eos>   their first pause was at the crown inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one of the sort , where a couple of pair of post - horses were kept , more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added ; it had been built many years ago for a ball - room , and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous , dancing state , had been occasionally used as such ;-- but such brilliant days had long passed away , and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half - gentlemen of the place .  <eos>   no : the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing , manly , open look , in no respect lessening his personal advantages .  <eos>   you divert me against my conscience .  <eos>   situated as we are with lady dalrymple , cousins , we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve .  <eos>   ` i am sure you must be ,' said he , ` and i will send you another supply ; for i have a great many more than i can ever use .  <eos>   mr . knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of getting them together , or some other cause , brought the colour into his face , as he answered ,  <eos>   there was no wound , no blood , no visible bruise ; but her eyes were closed , she breathed not , her face was like death .  <eos>   lady russell had another excellent one at hand , for being extremely glad that sir walter and his family were to remove from the country .  <eos>   your sister is an amiable creature ; but yours is the character of decision and firmness , i see .  <eos>   " i never read one more to the purpose , certainly ."  <eos>   this had happened the year before .  <eos>   " i am afraid ," returned emma , sighing , " that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy ."  <eos>   his profession qualified him , his disposition lead him , to talk ; and " that was in the year six ;" " that happened before i went to sea in the year six ," occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together : and though his voice did not falter , and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke , anne felt the utter impossibility , from her knowledge of his mind , that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself .  <eos>   i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with , who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece ."  <eos>   but this good old mr . woodhouse , i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner .  <eos>   it seemed an unnecessary caution ; jane was wanting to give her words , not to mrs . elton , but to miss woodhouse , as the latter plainly saw .  <eos>   lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne ' s known wishes .  <eos>   i will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world .  <eos>   emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour .  <eos>   chapter xi  <eos>   " i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them -- certain expressive looks , which i did not believe meant to be public ."  <eos>   on the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days .  <eos>   i will send you some more , before they get good for nothing .'  <eos>   i come in for a pretty good share as a second .  <eos>   at this moment mr . weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch .  <eos>   she had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared .  <eos>   " dreadful !-- exactly so , indeed .-- she will be missed every moment ."  <eos>   it was no longer in emma ' s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures .  <eos>   we really are so shocked !  <eos>   he has had great faults , faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness ; and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves : but still as he is , beyond a doubt , really attached to miss fairfax , and will soon , it may be hoped , have the advantage of being constantly with her , i am very ready to believe his character will improve , and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants .  <eos>   she cried with more thorough gaiety , " if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion .  <eos>   the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined , but he was at highbury very soon afterwards .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   there will not be time for any thing ."  <eos>   " no , indeed i do not ."  <eos>   every thing that i have said or done , for many weeks past , has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself .  <eos>   " never marry !-- this is a new resolution ."  <eos>   she prized the frank , the open - hearted , the eager character beyond all others .  <eos>   _miss_ _woodhouse_ appeared more than once , and never without a something of pleasing connexion , either a compliment to her taste , or a remembrance of what she had said ; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye , unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry , she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed .  <eos>   but you , ( turning to mr . knightley ,) who know how very , very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , i cannot imagine .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of lyme .  <eos>   the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate , to which all the rest of highbury belonged ; but their fortune , from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself , in every other kind of consequence ; and the woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which mr . elton had first entered not two years ago , to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade , or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility .-- but he had fancied her in love with him ; that evidently must have been his dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as ( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like mr . elton , in fancying himself a very decided favourite .  <eos>   he had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse was fond of society in his own way .  <eos>   true affection only could have prompted it ."  <eos>   she hardly wished to have more leisure for them .  <eos>   " might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it !  <eos>   " i do not know .-- one of the otways .-- not frank ;-- it is not frank , i assure you .  <eos>   your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage .  <eos>   but what is distance , mr . weston , to people of large fortune ?-- you would be amazed to hear how my brother , mr . suckling , sometimes flies about .  <eos>   she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs . elton ' s thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in miss fairfax ' s confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people .  <eos>   till now that she was threatened with its loss , emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with mr . knightley , first in interest and affection .-- satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been .-- long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella .  <eos>   " which makes his good manners the more valuable .  <eos>   her ignorance is hourly flattery .  <eos>   " so obliging of you !  <eos>   " no indeed i have not .  <eos>   i have not forgotten it , i assure you .-- deceived myself , i did very miserably deceive you -- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever .  <eos>   do you sit where you like ?  <eos>   it is a certainty .  <eos>   he shook his head and laughed .--" i cannot separate miss fairfax and her complexion ."  <eos>   harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness -- and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force .  <eos>   in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined ."  <eos>   of what sort ?"  <eos>   as to men and women , our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard to these children , i observe we never disagree ."  <eos>   she cried with more thorough gaiety , " if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion .  <eos>   they joined company and proceeded together .  <eos>   on its being proposed , anne offered her services , as usual ; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument , she was extremely glad to be employed , and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved .  <eos>   she thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual -- a glow both of complexion and spirits .  <eos>   the musgroves , like their houses , were in a state of alteration , perhaps of improvement .  <eos>   " miss fairfax , i suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ?"  <eos>   his goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible .  <eos>   it was the highest satisfaction to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning .  <eos>   harriet was too intent on the lines to hear .  <eos>   his enquiries , however , produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there , soon after his leaving the place .  <eos>   mr musgrove was , in a lesser degree , affected likewise ; and when they reached the cottage , they were evidently in want , first , of being listened to anew on this subject , and afterwards , of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them .  <eos>   " it will be natural for me ," he added shortly afterwards , " to speak my opinion aloud as i read .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   miss hamilton had left school , had married not long afterwards , was said to have married a man of fortune , and this was all that anne had known of her , till now that their governess ' s account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form .  <eos>   she and the children might stay very well ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   with a great deal of quiet observation , and a knowledge , which she often wished less , of her father ' s character , she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible .  <eos>   she was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more .  <eos>   lady russell ' s had no success at all : could not be put up with , were not to be borne .  <eos>   " i do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way .  <eos>   he had been most warmly attached to her , and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal ; but , except from some natural sensation of curiosity , he had no desire of meeting her again .  <eos>   " you may depend upon me ," said she .  <eos>   -- with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness .  <eos>   we must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment ."  <eos>   " handsome !  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   if a rich admiral were to come in our way , sir walter --"  <eos>   to suffer her to engage herself -- to suffer her even to think of such a measure !"  <eos>   now you are looking very sly .  <eos>   he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow .  <eos>   you must have heard him notice mrs clay ' s freckles ."  <eos>   -- with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness .  <eos>   miss woodhouse , how kind you are !-- i suppose you have heard -- and are come to give us joy .  <eos>   mr and mrs musgrove took me , and we were so crowded !  <eos>   " you talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear .  <eos>   knightley .-- neither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it might have happened at a better time -- and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter .-- they parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry ;-- it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion .-- he had been sitting with them half an hour , she found .  <eos>   it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william larkins .  <eos>   she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority , but she could not doubt his being rich ; and , in favour of his constancy , she had no reason to believe him married .  <eos>   emma ' s courage returned , and she walked on .  <eos>   he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield , as he was to be at home by the middle of the day .  <eos>   with respect to her father , it was a question soon answered .  <eos>   what a horrible idea !  <eos>   " i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls ."  <eos>   " i believe i have been very rude ; but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that i cannot keep my eyes from her .  <eos>   harriet was standing at one of the windows .  <eos>   " i am concerned to hear of it .  <eos>   " by all means .  <eos>   randalls is such a distance .  <eos>   frank churchill turned towards her to listen .  <eos>   " something a little inferior i shall of course put up with , but it must not be much .  <eos>   known to have some influence with her sister , she was continually requested , or at least receiving hints to exert it , beyond what was practicable .  <eos>   did you ever hear of that ?-- a water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard .  <eos>   whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , i dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet ."  <eos>   " but , captain wentworth ," cried louisa , " how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp , to see what an old thing they had given you ."  <eos>   how quick come the reasons for approving what we like !  <eos>   poor harriet !"  <eos>   how that visit was to be acknowledged -- what would be necessary -- and what might be safest , had been a point of some doubtful consideration .  <eos>   he had nestled down his head most conveniently .  <eos>   if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child , i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like .  <eos>   and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk ."  <eos>   " the joke ," he replied gravely , " seemed confined to you and mr .  <eos>   they are to be new set .  <eos>   ` how could he contrive to come ?  <eos>   " he has been wanting to come to us ," continued mr . weston , " ever since september : every letter has been full of it ; but he cannot command his own time .  <eos>   could i mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to mrs . goddard ?  <eos>   after a short pause , mr shepherd presumed to say --  <eos>   the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way -- just across the lawn ; and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind !  <eos>   " if he would be so good as to read to them , it would be a kindness indeed !  <eos>   i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well .  <eos>   the manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them .  <eos>   they were more in love with him ; yet there it was not love .  <eos>   come , and eat my strawberries .  <eos>   it was no longer in emma ' s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures .  <eos>   it was a sweet view -- sweet to the eye and the mind .  <eos>   after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look , compliments very quietly and properly taken , mrs . elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself -- and it was , " how do you like my gown ?-- how do you like my trimming ?-- how has wright done my hair ?"  <eos>   you really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself .-- to the post - office indeed !  <eos>   he had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife ' s occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to anne ' s admiration , and upon the whole , though there was very often a little disagreement ( in which she had sometimes more share than she wished , being appealed to by both parties ), they might pass for a happy couple .  <eos>   do you recommend this side ?-- well , i am sure , mr . churchill -- only it seems too good -- but just as you please .  <eos>   fortune i do not want ; employment i do not want ; consequence i do not want : i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband ' s house as i am of hartfield ; and never , never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man ' s eyes as i am in my father ' s ."  <eos>   not that james ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can .  <eos>   intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question .  <eos>   the coldness of a jane fairfax !-- harriet is worth a hundred such -- and for a wife -- a sensible man ' s wife -- it is invaluable .  <eos>   you divert me against my conscience .  <eos>   his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel wallis ' s companion might have as good a figure as colonel wallis , and certainly was not sandy - haired .  <eos>   miss bates was out , which accounted for the previous tranquillity .  <eos>   she plays charmingly ."  <eos>   there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man .  <eos>   it was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed , if it could be done , without any compromise of propriety on the side of the elliots ."  <eos>   he has encouragement enough to proceed , without our sighing out our souls over this charade ."  <eos>   said he , ` i can fasten the rivet .  <eos>   anne could only feel that charles hayter was wise .  <eos>   we are not all born to be handsome .  <eos>   she speaks a little too quick .  <eos>   he heard frank churchill next say , with a glance towards jane , " i will give it to her -- shall i ?"  <eos>   emma was just describing the nature of her friend ' s complaint ;-- " a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c . and she was sorry to find from mrs . goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them ."  <eos>   miss nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about mr . elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , " that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom mr . elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , mr . elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness ."  <eos>   they could think of no one else .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   very odd !  <eos>   it is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once , before they reach admiral baldwin ' s age ."  <eos>   i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere .  <eos>   emma then looked up , and immediately saw how it was ; and after a moment ' s debate , as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not , replied ,  <eos>   she held the parcel towards her , and emma read the words _most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top .  <eos>   i hope not of a putrid infectious sort .  <eos>   with a great deal of quiet observation , and a knowledge , which she often wished less , of her father ' s character , she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible .  <eos>   we explored to king ' s - weston twice last summer , in that way , most delightfully , just after their first having the barouche - landau .  <eos>   he was to leave them early the next day ; and he soon began with --  <eos>   " poor jane fairfax !"  <eos>   " emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old .  <eos>   this gallant young man , who seemed to love without feeling , and to recommend himself without complaisance , directly handed over the word to miss fairfax , and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   for a few days , every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs . weston had received .  <eos>   emma pondered a moment , and then replied , " i will not pretend _not_ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of ."  <eos>   picture to yourselves my amazement ; i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin .  <eos>   it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings , with half a heart .  <eos>   the young people were all wild to see lyme .  <eos>   will it make you happy ?  <eos>   where a man does his best with only moderate powers , he will have the advantage over negligent superiority .  <eos>   he seemed about thirty , and though not handsome , had an agreeable person .  <eos>   after a short struggle , however , charles hayter seemed to quit the field .  <eos>   only let me be told when i may speak out .-- i wonder whether jane has any suspicion ."  <eos>   eight years , almost eight years had passed , since all had been given up .  <eos>   he was tolerably cheerful .  <eos>   you must promise me not to sit up ."  <eos>   and as for objects of interest , objects for the affections , which is in truth the great point of inferiority , the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in _not_ marrying , i shall be very well off , with all the children of a sister i love so much , to care about .  <eos>   i was sure that would come out , if it was so .  <eos>   he might be able to join them in the evening , but certainly not to dinner .  <eos>   she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .  <eos>   it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives isabella all her popularity .-- i have it not -- but i know how to prize and respect it .-- harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives .  <eos>   you can borrow mrs . cole ' s .  <eos>   her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what .  <eos>   it was being very deficient ."  <eos>   no , she had had enough of interference .  <eos>   but he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that emma could not help saying ,  <eos>   _she_ was not present when the suspicion first arose .  <eos>   but charles is so positive !  <eos>   and what is her attraction ?  <eos>   she stopped to breathe .  <eos>   at one time patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping .  <eos>   he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether i thought her too young : in short , whether i approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _your_ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him .  <eos>   " only one more , papa ; only for mr . elton .  <eos>   she is very fond of frank , and therefore i would not speak ill of her .  <eos>   a most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross ."  <eos>   mrs . and miss bates occupied the drawing - room floor ; and there , in the very moderate - sized apartment , which was every thing to them , the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed ; the quiet neat old lady , who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse , and her more active , talking daughter , almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness , thanks for their visit , solicitude for their shoes , anxious inquiries after mr . woodhouse ' s health , cheerful communications about her mother ' s , and sweet - cake from the beaufet --" mrs . cole had just been there , just called in for ten minutes , and had been so good as to sit an hour with them , and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much ; and , therefore , she hoped miss woodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too ."  <eos>   said she , with a conscious look .  <eos>   i am sure she does .  <eos>   a miss hawkins of bath .  <eos>   i knew you would wish it .  <eos>   " nobody knew how much she should suffer .  <eos>   "' tis twelve ; i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here .  <eos>   till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar - bone was soon replaced , and though mr robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew ' s state , as to give the information of captain wentworth ' s visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before .  <eos>   " i honour his sincerity .  <eos>   i am exceedingly obliged to you , mrs . elton , i am obliged to any body who feels for me , but i am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer .  <eos>   " they come on the admiral ' s account .  <eos>   had she not imagined herself consulting his good , even more than her own , she could hardly have given him up .  <eos>   but they live very comfortably .  <eos>   after a short pause , mr shepherd presumed to say --  <eos>   but between _us_ , i am convinced there never can be any likeness , except in being unmarried ."  <eos>   she could do little more than listen patiently , soften every grievance , and excuse each to the other ; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours , and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister ' s benefit .  <eos>   mr . knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence -- so shocked !-- jane and i are both so shocked about the apples !"  <eos>   her intentions were unchanged .  <eos>   he thought we walked towards randalls most days .  <eos>   at this moment they were approaching ford ' s , and he hastily exclaimed , " ha !  <eos>   let me entreat you to run no risks .  <eos>   if you want any farther explanation ," continued he , smiling , " they are paid for it .  <eos>   during his present short stay , emma had barely seen him ; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over , and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension , now spread over his air .  <eos>   " it was at gibraltar , mother , i know .  <eos>   emma could have wished mrs . elton elsewhere ; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body ; and as mrs . elton met her with unusual graciousness , she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed .  <eos>   in that respect mrs . weston ' s loss had been important .  <eos>   i will go and tell charles , and get ready directly .  <eos>   i am not like jane ; i wish i were .  <eos>   " never mind , harriet , i shall not be a poor old maid ; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public !  <eos>   " four o ' clock !-- depend upon it he will be here by three ," was mr . weston ' s quick amendment ; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting .  <eos>   oh , no !  <eos>   oh , said i , patty do not come with your bad news to me .  <eos>   to restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up -- her hand seized -- her attention demanded , and mr . elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping -- fearing -- adoring -- ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .  <eos>   a sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle .  <eos>   i always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours .-- my dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork -- a roast loin of pork --"  <eos>   it was the same , the very same man , with no difference but of dress .  <eos>   but they always do , you know .  <eos>   " on your side , my love , it was very innocently done .  <eos>   weston , tell me at once .-- something has happened in brunswick square .  <eos>   i want you to call me something else , but i do not know what ."  <eos>   his spirits required support .  <eos>   as an old friend , you will allow me to hope , miss fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have ."  <eos>   however , she is very agreeable , and mrs . bates too , in a different way .  <eos>   how improperly had she been acting by harriet !  <eos>   miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl .  <eos>   and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk ."  <eos>   " what was i talking of ?"  <eos>   it was some days before she saw jane fairfax , to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change ; but when they did meet , her composure was odious .  <eos>   chapter xvi  <eos>   i have thought only of you .  <eos>   another hour or two ' s snow can hardly make the road impassable ; and we are two carriages ; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand .  <eos>   so i begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , i could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for jane ; and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and jane said the same .  <eos>   " not i , indeed .  <eos>   " being my friend ' s , i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye , but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it ."  <eos>   it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father , and with what she felt for him .  <eos>   had not mrs . weston any letter about her to produce ?"  <eos>   ' tis a sad business ."  <eos>   my poor mother does not know how to bear it .  <eos>   and as for harriet , i will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance .  <eos>   his sanguine temper , and fearlessness of mind , operated very differently on her .  <eos>   " i am most happy to hear it -- but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior !-- and exactly emma ' s age ."  <eos>   her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given .  <eos>   you , who have not a mother ' s feelings , are a great deal the properest person .  <eos>   i remember it was written from weymouth , and dated sept . 28th -- and began , ` my dear madam ,' but i forget how it went on ; and it was signed ` f . c . weston churchill .'  <eos>   the gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable ;-- but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at south end , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin .  <eos>   with all dear emma ' s little faults , she is an excellent creature .  <eos>   " i suspect they do not satisfy mrs . weston .  <eos>   i knew the name , the place , i knew all about it , and instantly saw what she had been doing .  <eos>   no "-- and emma could just catch the words , " so superior to mr .  <eos>   i knew how it would be .  <eos>   she had a moment ' s fear of miss bates keeping away from her .  <eos>   we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief ."  <eos>   " emma ," said she , " this paper is worse than i expected .  <eos>   in the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing harriet .-- it would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther .-- she was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing harriet ' s confidence .  <eos>   knightley .'  <eos>   anne suppressed a smile , and listened kindly , while mrs musgrove relieved her heart a little more ; and for a few minutes , therefore , could not keep pace with the conversation of the others .  <eos>   the high - spirited , joyous - talking louisa musgrove , and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading , captain benwick , seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other .  <eos>   you are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference ."  <eos>   to restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up -- her hand seized -- her attention demanded , and mr . elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping -- fearing -- adoring -- ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .  <eos>   well !  <eos>   but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present ."  <eos>   she could not be too soon alarmed , nor send for perry too often .  <eos>   there had been the charm .  <eos>   if there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment .  <eos>   anne entered it with a sinking heart , anticipating an imprisonment of many months , and anxiously saying to herself , " oh !  <eos>   " i am perfectly satisfied ," replied emma , with the brightest smiles , " and most sincerely wish them happy ."  <eos>   miss smith , pray take care .  <eos>   " no , not mr . knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though i thought he would come , because mrs . elton declared she would not let him off , he did not ;-- but my mother , and jane , and i , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had .  <eos>   this is a connexion which offers nothing but good .  <eos>   cole ."  <eos>   charles was to return to lyme the same afternoon , and his father had at first half a mind to go with him , but the ladies could not consent .  <eos>   let me return your congratulations .-- i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction .-- he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise ."  <eos>   emma , who was not really at all frightened herself , tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs . goddard ' s experience and care ; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away , which she would rather feed and assist than not , she added soon afterwards -- as if quite another subject ,  <eos>   it was the same , the very same man , with no difference but of dress .  <eos>   " how much i am obliged to you ," said he , " for telling me to come to - day !-- if it had not been for you , i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party .  <eos>   the girls were now hunting for the laconia ; and captain wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble , and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate , and present non - commissioned class , observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had .  <eos>   " i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two ; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine .  <eos>   the invitation was general , and generally declined .  <eos>   mr . knightley loves to find fault with me , you know -- in a joke -- it is all a joke .  <eos>   she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr . elton .  <eos>   sir walter was not very wise ; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel , that a more unobjectionable tenant , in all essentials , than admiral croft bid fair to be , could hardly offer .  <eos>   do you know any family of that name ?"  <eos>   i am almost ashamed to say it ."  <eos>   he gave her to understand that frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly .  <eos>   they shew her to the greatest advantage .  <eos>   jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold .  <eos>   there must be ample room in it for every real comfort .  <eos>   in such a party , harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise ; but for the poor girl herself , it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment .  <eos>   now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs . goddard ' s to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch ."  <eos>   when the westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , the strongest of admiration were for her , from both husband and wife ; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and , as she firmly believed , not without some dexterity on his side .  <eos>   " and the next news , i suppose , will be , that we are to lose you -- just as i begin to know you ."  <eos>   with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross , it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination , her memory , and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   my right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question .  <eos>   only three of us .-- besides dear jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it .  <eos>   it must be very clever , or he would not have brought it .  <eos>   he does not read ?"  <eos>   i am sure i do not know who is not ."  <eos>   a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction , as the most graceful set of limbs in the world .  <eos>   sir , you are most kind .  <eos>   twelve years had changed anne from the blooming , silent , unformed girl of fifteen , to the elegant little woman of seven - and - twenty , with every beauty except bloom , and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle ; and twelve years had transformed the fine - looking , well - grown miss hamilton , in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority , into a poor , infirm , helpless widow , receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour ; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away , and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times .  <eos>   cried she playfully .  <eos>   asked elizabeth .  <eos>   but this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength ; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at winthrop , as she felt so tired , she resolutely answered , " oh !  <eos>   she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man , for she hardly knew what indisposition was ; and if he did not invent illnesses for her , she could make no figure in a message .  <eos>   " if i did not know her to be happy now ," said emma , seriously , " which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , i could not bear these thanks ;-- for , oh !  <eos>   mr . woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and isabella ' s coming , and of emma ' s being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and mrs . weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma .  <eos>   my dear , but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good ; and as to myself , i have been long perfectly convinced , though perhaps i never told you so before , that the sea is very rarely of use to any body .  <eos>   he saw his son every year in london , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too .  <eos>   " you , emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck !"  <eos>   he had , in fact , though his sisters were now doing all they could for him , by calling him " poor richard ," been nothing better than a thick - headed , unfeeling , unprofitable dick musgrove , who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name , living or dead .  <eos>   there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs . john knightley , in this short visit to hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister .  <eos>   " they would look around them , no doubt , and bless their good fortune ," said mrs clay , for mrs clay was present : her father had driven her over , nothing being of so much use to mrs clay ' s health as a drive to kellynch : " but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant .  <eos>   emma had not another word to oppose .  <eos>   she knows now what gentlemen are ; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet ."  <eos>   where a man does his best with only moderate powers , he will have the advantage over negligent superiority .  <eos>   " what a very great pleasure it will be to you !  <eos>   her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give .  <eos>   she was sure that he had not been happy in marriage .  <eos>   the party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms , and still descending , soon found themselves on the sea - shore ; and lingering only , as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea , who ever deserved to look on it at all , proceeded towards the cobb , equally their object in itself and on captain wentworth ' s account : for in a small house , near the foot of an old pier of unknown date , were the harvilles settled .  <eos>   his first proposition and request , that the dance begun at mr . cole ' s should be finished there -- that the same party should be collected , and the same musician engaged , met with the readiest acquiescence .  <eos>   that is the fact , upon my honour , mary knows it is ."  <eos>   and such a noble fire !-- i am quite roasted .  <eos>   " one can suppose nothing else ," added mrs . cole , " and i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt .  <eos>   i have not nerves for the sort of thing ."  <eos>   my poor mother does not know how to bear it .  <eos>   but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place .  <eos>   i saw her as i came in ; she was standing in the entrance .  <eos>   i am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do .  <eos>   " i should have been sorry , mr . knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had i quitted mr . woodhouse ' s family and wanted another situation ; i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body .  <eos>   a man who had been in motion since eight o ' clock in the morning , and might now have been still , who had been long talking , and might have been silent , who had been in more than one crowd , and might have been alone !-- such a man , to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside , and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the world !-- could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife , there would have been a motive ; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject .  <eos>   " i have let my house to admiral croft ," would sound extremely well ; very much better than to any mere mr --; a mr ( save , perhaps , some half dozen in the nation ,) always needs a note of explanation .  <eos>   i have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal ."  <eos>   mr . knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of mr . woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in isabella ' s first day .  <eos>   i am sorry for _her_ .  <eos>   but i can remember nothing ;-- not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention ; i can only recollect the first stanza ; and there are several .  <eos>   he was often hoping , intending to come -- but was always prevented .  <eos>   how did you all behave ?  <eos>   they added to their house , to their number of servants , to their expenses of every sort ; and by this time were , in fortune and style of living , second only to the family at hartfield .  <eos>   she talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for emma ' s attention ; it was soon gone to brunswick square or to donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when mrs . weston ended with , " we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but i hope it will soon come ," she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for .  <eos>   " i declare , i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction !-- it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument .  <eos>   it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin .  <eos>   it was an afternoon of distress , and anne had every thing to do at once ; the apothecary to send for , the father to have pursued and informed , the mother to support and keep from hysterics , the servants to control , the youngest child to banish , and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe ; besides sending , as soon as she recollected it , proper notice to the other house , which brought her an accession rather of frightened , enquiring companions , than of very useful assistants .  <eos>   " i do not know .-- one of the otways .-- not frank ;-- it is not frank , i assure you .  <eos>   emma had done .  <eos>   if he were quite sincere , if he really tried to come , it was to be inferred that mrs . churchill ' s removal to london had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder .  <eos>   mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister ' s account ; but , however , louisa is a great favourite with both .  <eos>   martin !"  <eos>   i am sure she does .  <eos>   i should not have used the expression .  <eos>   then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth , but now she liked it not .  <eos>   it was no longer in emma ' s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures .  <eos>   ` old fellow !'  <eos>   " mr . knightley was there too , was he ?"  <eos>   i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne ?"  <eos>   " i must have asked miss fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your ' s ."  <eos>   " that ' s quite unnecessary ; i see jane every day :-- but as you like .  <eos>   " i perfectly agree with you , sir ,"-- was then his remark .  <eos>   quite a humourist .  <eos>   i think their father is too rough with them very often ."  <eos>   i bring a new proposal on the subject :-- a thought of my father ' s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon .  <eos>   you were very popular before you came , because you were mr . weston ' s son -- but lay out half a guinea at ford ' s , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues ."  <eos>   mrs . weston wants to see you .  <eos>   " i do not wonder , miss woodhouse ," she resumed , " that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body .  <eos>   emma could not forgive her ;-- but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr . knightley , who had been of the party , and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side , he was expressing the next morning , being at hartfield again on business with mr . woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma .  <eos>   she remembered what mr . knightley had once said to her about mr . elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that mr . elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself .  <eos>   " such an eye !-- the true hazle eye -- and so brilliant !  <eos>   by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make , admiral croft was a native of somersetshire , who having acquired a very handsome fortune , was wishing to settle in his own country , and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood , which , however , had not suited him ; that accidentally hearing --( it was just as he had foretold , mr shepherd observed , sir walter ' s concerns could not be kept a secret ,)-- accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let , and understanding his ( mr shepherd ' s ) connection with the owner , he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries , and had , in the course of a pretty long conference , expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel ; and given mr shepherd , in his explicit account of himself , every proof of his being a most responsible , eligible tenant .  <eos>   he could not forgive her , but he could not be unfeeling .  <eos>   they , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed .  <eos>   " there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ ,"-- said mr . knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done .  <eos>   " might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ?"  <eos>   i think your manners to him encouraging .  <eos>   " i have no doubt of their being happy together ," said emma ; " i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached ."  <eos>   " upon my word ," said emma , " i begin to doubt my having any such talent .  <eos>   she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish .  <eos>   " oh !"  <eos>   they continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of miss campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of mr . dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn .  <eos>   you know we have settled all that already .  <eos>   soon after this miss bates came in , and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself , resulting , she supposed , from doubt of what might be said , and impatience to say every thing .  <eos>   in general he was judged , throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- mr . knightley .  <eos>   " she always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all .  <eos>   selina says it is quite horror to her -- and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety .  <eos>   miss woodhouse !  <eos>   " they talked a great deal about him , especially anne cox .  <eos>   mrs . weston ' s communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax .  <eos>   and mr . dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him .  <eos>   she stopped to breathe .  <eos>   it was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harriet ' s coming to hartfield .  <eos>   it does happen very often , i assure you ; but my sister makes nothing of it ; she would as lieve be tossed out as not ."  <eos>   for i think you have a little cold , and patty has been washing the kitchen .'--` oh !  <eos>   she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her ;-- _she_ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner ,  <eos>   i have not seen one of them to - day , except mr musgrove , who just stopped and spoke through the window , but without getting off his horse ; and though i told him how ill i was , not one of them have been near me .  <eos>   elton , and miss hawkins !-- good morning to you ."  <eos>   it is remarkable , that emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded .  <eos>   it shews what a sad invalid i am !  <eos>   certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , mrs . elton .  <eos>   i am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond ;-- and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree .  <eos>   " dear me !-- how should i ever have borne it !  <eos>   if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman , i grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , i am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy .  <eos>   what are harriet smith ' s claims , either of birth , nature or education , to any connexion higher than robert martin ?  <eos>   and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister , who was _very_ _well_ _married_ , to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_ , near bristol , who kept two carriages !  <eos>   she was pleased , on taking leave , to find miss fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say ,  <eos>   " i have not been working uninterruptedly ," he replied , " i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , i believe .  <eos>   how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates ?  <eos>   no , my dear little modest harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow .  <eos>   at present , i ask only to hear , once to hear your voice ."  <eos>   mr elliot had called repeatedly , had dined with them once , evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked , for they gave no dinners in general ; delighted , in short , by every proof of cousinly notice , and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in camden place .  <eos>   sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr . woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of emma .  <eos>   emma was extremely confused .  <eos>   mrs . weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but emma ' s countenance was as steady as her words .  <eos>   she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement .  <eos>   her eye half met captain wentworth ' s , a bow , a curtsey passed ; she heard his voice ; he talked to mary , said all that was right , said something to the miss musgroves , enough to mark an easy footing ; the room seemed full , full of persons and voices , but a few minutes ended it .  <eos>   he had , by that time , realised an easy competence -- enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury , which he had always longed for -- enough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition .  <eos>   the information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins .  <eos>   a crowd in a little room -- miss woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words .  <eos>   he had a great regard for mrs . goddard ; and emma should write a line , and invite her .  <eos>   and as to its recommendations to _you_ , i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell on them .  <eos>   i was a kinder friend than you deserved .  <eos>   witness this very time .  <eos>   " for when a lady ' s in the case , " you know all other things give place ."  <eos>   however it might end , he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in bath : she saw nobody equal to him ; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme , which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again , and to see more of , as herself .  <eos>   it was a very fine november day , and the miss musgroves came through the little grounds , and stopped for no other purpose than to say , that they were going to take a long walk , and therefore concluded mary could not like to go with them ; and when mary immediately replied , with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker , " oh , yes , i should like to join you very much , i am very fond of a long walk ;" anne felt persuaded , by the looks of the two girls , that it was precisely what they did not wish , and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce , of everything being to be communicated , and everything being to be done together , however undesired and inconvenient .  <eos>   excepting yourself and your brother , i do not know his equal for temper .  <eos>   one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to emma -- its being fixed for a day within the granted term of frank churchill ' s stay in surry ; for , in spite of mr . weston ' s confidence , she could not think it so very impossible that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " it is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , i should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , i do not like to interfere , as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr . and mrs . weston .  <eos>   " how do you do , mrs . ford ?  <eos>   is not she an angel in every gesture ?  <eos>   ay ,-- mr wentworth , the curate of monkford .  <eos>   she might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if i had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as i used to think him .  <eos>   you will be adored in highbury .  <eos>   it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend ' s leaving highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well .  <eos>   very well ; i shall not attempt to deny emma ' s being pretty ."  <eos>   she wished him to speak , but he would not .  <eos>   in general he was judged , throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- mr . knightley .  <eos>   the churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   exclaimed mr . knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , " no , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation .  <eos>   she watched , observed , reflected , and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only .  <eos>   you are too obliging !  <eos>   you remember him , i am sure ."  <eos>   he must be either indifferent or unwilling .  <eos>   " and the staircase -- you know , as i came in , i observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house .  <eos>   he was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with :-- but the girl who could be gratified by a robert martin ' s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr . elton ' s admiration .  <eos>   " and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday , and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following -- as you will find from jane ' s letter .  <eos>   " i never read one more to the purpose , certainly ."  <eos>   " you will soon be cooler , if you sit still ," said emma .  <eos>   " i felt my luck , admiral , i assure you ;" replied captain wentworth , seriously .  <eos>   she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment .-- such was the blood of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for !-- it was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for mr . knightley -- or for the churchills -- or even for mr .  <eos>   and , without love , i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine .  <eos>   one would fancy we were bosom friends !  <eos>   " and really , i do not think the impression will soon be over ," said emma , as she crossed the low hedge , and tottering footstep which ended the narrow , slippery path through the cottage garden , and brought them into the lane again .  <eos>   the musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come , particularly in the morning , when he had no companion at home , for the admiral and mrs croft were generally out of doors together , interesting themselves in their new possessions , their grass , and their sheep , and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person , or driving out in a gig , lately added to their establishment .  <eos>   mr . weston ' s own happiness was indisputable .  <eos>   i come in for a pretty good share as a second .  <eos>   " dear me !-- it is so odd to hear a woman talk so !"  <eos>   but fetch them both .  <eos>   she was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all .  <eos>   " you spent the evening with mrs .  <eos>   " knightley !"  <eos>   her father -- and harriet .  <eos>   she recovered her voice .  <eos>   quite worn out and broken up .  <eos>   your inexperience really amuses me !  <eos>   how fast i made money in her .  <eos>   i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together .  <eos>   all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath ; and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss fairfax ' s handwriting .  <eos>   mr . elton must now be left to himself .  <eos>   the day approached , the day arrived ; and after a morning of some anxious watching , frank churchill , in all the certainty of his own self , reached randalls before dinner , and every thing was safe .  <eos>   where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was .  <eos>   unwelcome as it was , mr . woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter ' s attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them .  <eos>   i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm .  <eos>   ford ."  <eos>   how the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep !  <eos>   " upon my word , emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too .  <eos>   it was quite a different sort of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent .  <eos>   there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction , and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow .  <eos>   cried sir walter .  <eos>   she knew it well ; and she remembered another person ' s look also .  <eos>   leave all that to me .  <eos>   said jane , shaking her head ; " dear mrs . elton , who can have thought of it as i have done ?"  <eos>   a situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ' s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly ."  <eos>   admiral croft ' s manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell , but they delighted anne .  <eos>   i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : i feel sure that he is not .  <eos>   highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals .  <eos>   she gave a slight glance round the table , and applied herself to it .  <eos>   to look on , while repeated attentions were offering to another woman , before her face , and not resent it .-- that is a degree of placidity , which i can neither comprehend nor respect ."  <eos>   said he ; so i just mentioned .  <eos>   she was so wretched and so vehement , complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of anne ; anne , who was nothing to louisa , while she was her sister , and had the best right to stay in henrietta ' s stead !  <eos>   elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match .  <eos>   intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question .  <eos>   he had met with them in a little perplexity , which must be laid before emma .  <eos>   " he had been so fortunate as to -- i forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them .  <eos>   this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory , and decided the whole business at once .  <eos>   it was so with elizabeth , still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and sir walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing .  <eos>   her caution was thrown away .  <eos>   that i had not given way to her at the fatal moment !  <eos>   " he trifles here ," said he , " as to the temptation .  <eos>   good soul !  <eos>   _she_ could not .  <eos>   she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home .  <eos>   you like mr . elton , papa ,-- i must look about for a wife for him .  <eos>   if he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and i hope we may be able to convince him and elizabeth , that kellynch hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle .  <eos>   he wished to persuade mr . woodhouse , as well as emma , to join the party ; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill . mr . woodhouse must not , under the specious pretence of a morning drive , and an hour or two spent at donwell , be tempted away to his misery .  <eos>   yes , i observed it , i assure you .  <eos>   when a gallant young man , like mr . frank churchill ," said mr . knightley dryly , " writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best ."  <eos>   they had been once more in the same room .  <eos>   he could refer sir walter to all who knew him ; and certainly , the pains he had been taking on this , the first opportunity of reconciliation , to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir - presumptive , was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject .  <eos>   it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father , and with what she felt for him .  <eos>   " no -- i cannot call them gifts ; but they are things that i have valued very much ."  <eos>   there was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for mr . weston immediately accosted her with ,  <eos>   i hope it does him some service with you ."  <eos>   composure with a witness !  <eos>   they would be very much pleased ."  <eos>   " oh yes ; next week ."  <eos>   they were not much interested in anything relative to anne ; but still there were questions enough asked , to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was ; and elizabeth was disdainful , and sir walter severe .  <eos>   harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love .  <eos>   it will be some trial to us both ."  <eos>   " this will not be your only visit to randalls ."  <eos>   " no , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed ."  <eos>   she , therefore , said no more for some time .  <eos>   " now i have done ," cried captain wentworth .  <eos>   a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood ."  <eos>   " you are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came .  <eos>   it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other -- and we were persuaded that it was so .-- imagine what we have been feeling on your account ."  <eos>   she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout - cakes , and there being no ice in the highbury card - parties .  <eos>   mr . churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife ' s : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence !  <eos>   that he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through emma ' s brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled .  <eos>   i feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that i shall soon be abroad .  <eos>   i must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , i should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known .-- ` jane ,' indeed !-- you will observe that i have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you .  <eos>   it was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been .  <eos>   .  <eos>   volume ii  <eos>   i think she would be so much pleased with his mind , that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner ."  <eos>   on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft ' s seeing kellynch hall , anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell ' s , and keep out of the way till all was over ; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them .  <eos>   " that i am sure you would .  <eos>   with a faint blush , she presently replied ,  <eos>   if we were not related , it would not signify ; but as cousins , she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours .  <eos>   elton !--` jane fairfax and jane fairfax .'  <eos>   " by all means , if you can ."  <eos>   " it was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face ."  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement , and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends -- for the house was taken for may and june .  <eos>   mrs . elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly .  <eos>   " mr . elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct !  <eos>   " me !"  <eos>   " well , my dear jane , i believe we must be running away .  <eos>   the dinner , already ordered at the inn , was at last , though unwillingly , accepted as a excuse ; but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth should have brought any such party to lyme , without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them .  <eos>   " the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me .  <eos>   he would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration -- made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner -- would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do .  <eos>   the most unaccountable business !  <eos>   you must , indeed , you must ."  <eos>   this was not submitted to by either lady .  <eos>   now , upon his father ' s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place .  <eos>   anne was to leave them on the morrow , an event which they all dreaded .  <eos>   " we must ask mr . and mrs . weston to dine with us , while isabella is here ."  <eos>   it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock , without retaining any influence to alarm .  <eos>   she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations ; but it was not possible , that when within reach of captain wentworth ' s conversation with either of the miss musgroves , she should not try to hear it ; yet she caught little very remarkable .  <eos>   i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls .  <eos>   " pray ," said captain wentworth , immediately , " can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away ?"  <eos>   " i remember once calling you ` george ,' in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago .  <eos>   here was a dangerous opening .  <eos>   i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond ."  <eos>   " my feelings , you see , did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth ."  <eos>   and she and her partner the happiest !--" i said it would be so ," was the only consolation .  <eos>   sir walter , elizabeth and mrs clay , returned one morning from laura place , with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple for the same evening , and anne was already engaged , to spend that evening in westgate buildings .  <eos>   one cannot wonder , one cannot wonder .  <eos>   " i could manage them very well , if it were not for mary ' s interference ," was what anne often heard him say , and had a good deal of faith in ; but when listening in turn to mary ' s reproach of " charles spoils the children so that i cannot get them into any order ," she never had the smallest temptation to say , " very true ."  <eos>   to be sure ," cried emma , " it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage .  <eos>   but while so many were devoting him to emma , and emma herself making him over to harriet , mr . knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax .  <eos>   i will tell you why she is out of spirits .  <eos>   i assure you i feel it none .  <eos>   they called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as i understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain .-- she made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving .  <eos>   the next morning brought mr . frank churchill again .  <eos>   poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change ."  <eos>   harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emma ' s .  <eos>   cried mr . knightley .  <eos>   i think not .  <eos>   do not you remember what mr . perry said , so many years ago , when i had the measles ?  <eos>   but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january ."  <eos>   woodhouse ?-- i am so glad .-- quite out of my power .-- such a happy little circle as you find us here .-- yes , indeed .-- charming young man !-- that is -- so very friendly ; i mean good mr .  <eos>   emma turned away her head , divided between tears and smiles .  <eos>   once , i felt the fire rather too much ; but then i moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me .  <eos>   repeated emma .  <eos>   my dear sir , you really are too bountiful .  <eos>   he had not forgiven anne elliot .  <eos>   the very first subject after being seated was maple grove , " my brother mr . suckling ' s seat ;"-- a comparison of hartfield to maple grove .  <eos>   she might talk on ; and if he wanted to say any thing himself , he would only talk louder , and drown her voice .  <eos>   _what_ she was , must be uncertain ; but _who_ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the , l ., it did not appear that she was at all harriet ' s superior .  <eos>   there is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere .-- she is _not_ to be with the _dixons_ .  <eos>   " i have reason to think ," he replied , " that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter :-- robert martin is the man .  <eos>   " most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse was quite at ease ; and the seeing him so , with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate , removed the chief of even emma ' s vexation .  <eos>   " i am afraid ," returned emma , sighing , " that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy ."  <eos>   " i not aware !"  <eos>   no -- i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it .  <eos>   is it kingdom ?  <eos>   they ascended and passed him ; and as they passed , anne ' s face caught his eye , and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration , which she could not be insensible of .  <eos>   " i hope mrs . bates and miss fairfax are --"  <eos>   but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism .  <eos>   " donwell !"  <eos>   " altered beyond his knowledge ."  <eos>   no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern ; it was the language of real feeling towards mrs . weston ; and the transition from highbury to enscombe , the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt , and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety .-- the charm of her own name was not wanting .  <eos>   " perhaps she might ; but it is not every man ' s fate to marry the woman who loves him best .  <eos>   " i would rather be talking to you ," he replied ; " but as it seems a matter of justice , it shall be done ."  <eos>   " if mrs . gilbert wishes to dance ," said he , " i shall have great pleasure , i am sure -- for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs .  <eos>   my nephews and nieces !-- i shall often have a niece with me ."  <eos>   she had suffered very much from cramp after dancing , and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless -- and in this state , and exceedingly terrified , she had been obliged to remain .  <eos>   the answer soon presented itself .  <eos>   you are your mother ' s self in countenance and disposition ; and if i might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued !  <eos>   cried sir basil , ` it is admiral baldwin .  <eos>   bless me !  <eos>   " oh no ; as to leaving the little boy ," both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought ; and anne , in the joy of the escape , could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs .  <eos>   he came down by yesterday ' s coach , and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast , to report his proceedings , first on my affairs , and then on his own .  <eos>   " as soon as my aunt gets well , i shall go abroad ," said he .  <eos>   however , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration .  <eos>   as to connexion , there emma was perfectly easy ; persuaded , that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet , he had done nothing .  <eos>   thank you , my mother is remarkably well .  <eos>   you made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all that can be said ."  <eos>   " very ."  <eos>   seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment , and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving ; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency .  <eos>   i think their father is too rough with them very often ."  <eos>   yes , i am sure you are much too reasonable .  <eos>   " but i am very much , and without being at all ashamed of it .  <eos>   always my kindest friend on every occasion .  <eos>   he had given it , he could assure her , very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning , to have his thoughts to himself .  <eos>   " so far as that it relates to mr . frank churchill , i do guess ."  <eos>   harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games ; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good - humoured and obliging .  <eos>   very delightful indeed ; i can say nothing less , for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr . frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes .  <eos>   she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr . elton ; and harriet ' s mind , she had been willing to hope , had been lately gaining strength .  <eos>   i have great hope of prevailing .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   the harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at uppercross , whenever she returned .  <eos>   every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month .  <eos>   " business , you know , may bring money , but friendship hardly ever does ."  <eos>   he was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .  <eos>   they were sick with horror , while he examined ; but he was not hopeless .  <eos>   she bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause .  <eos>   the two families had always been on excellent terms , there being no pride on one side , and no envy on the other , and only such a consciousness of superiority in the miss musgroves , as made them pleased to improve their cousins .  <eos>   there could be no harm in a scheme , a mere passive scheme .  <eos>   quick and decided in her ways , emma lost no time in inviting , encouraging , and telling her to come very often ; and as their acquaintance increased , so did their satisfaction in each other .  <eos>   " you will not like him , i will answer for it ."  <eos>   knightley .--" robert martin ' s manners have sense , sincerity , and good - humour to recommend them ; and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand ."  <eos>   _she_ disapproved them , which ought to have been enough .-- my plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient .-- she was displeased ; i thought unreasonably so : i thought her , on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious : i thought her even cold .  <eos>   the conversation was here interrupted .  <eos>   aye , i know your scruples .  <eos>   captain benwick is very well , i believe , but he is a very odd young man .  <eos>   " emma ," said she , " this paper is worse than i expected .  <eos>   i am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating .-- i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties ."  <eos>   after one of the many praises of the day , which were continually bursting forth , captain wentworth added : --  <eos>   she cried with more thorough gaiety , " if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion .  <eos>   but why must she consent to be with the eltons ?-- here is quite a separate puzzle ."  <eos>   and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies ."  <eos>   i am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating .-- i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties ."  <eos>   " mr . elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct !  <eos>   it ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency .  <eos>   it would be impossible to say what emma felt , on hearing this -- which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost .  <eos>   knightley .-- it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour , as if his eyes received the truth from her ' s , and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured .-- he looked at her with a glow of regard .  <eos>   she appeared to me to play well , that is , with considerable taste , but i know nothing of the matter myself .-- i am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body ' s performance .-- i have been used to hear her ' s admired ; and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well :-- a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- on the point of marriage -- would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead -- never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other .  <eos>   leave shame to her .  <eos>   but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at hartfield ; that so long as her father ' s happiness in other words his life -- required hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise .  <eos>   " imprudent , if you please -- but not mad .  <eos>   without emulating the feelings of an emma towards her henry , she would have attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard , for his sake ; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend .  <eos>   only my pattern gown is at hartfield .  <eos>   " well , i am so sorry !-- oh !  <eos>   a large party secures its own amusement .  <eos>   one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes , though i know you must fifty times .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " my dear harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade .-- you will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it .  <eos>   thank god !  <eos>   he certainly might have heard mr . elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and mr . elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , mr . knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives .  <eos>   " now ," said harriet , " you _must_ recollect ."  <eos>   his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel wallis ' s companion might have as good a figure as colonel wallis , and certainly was not sandy - haired .  <eos>   said mrs . weston in a trembling voice .  <eos>   after some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank mrs . weston , look sorrowful , and have done .  <eos>   her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour .  <eos>   " she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there .  <eos>   here was a dangerous opening .  <eos>   she inherits her mother ' s talents , and must have been under subjection to her ."  <eos>   think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of mr . knightley ' s marrying jane fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt .  <eos>   mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as elizabeth , nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort .  <eos>   he walked off in more complete self - approbation than he left for her .  <eos>   " true .  <eos>   it was the same , the very same man , with no difference but of dress .  <eos>   he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived .  <eos>   the intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by emma and mr .  <eos>   ` i will not say , that since i entered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments ; but i can say , that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour :'-- and the quivering lip , emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that i felt at my heart ."  <eos>   i met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son ' s hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to mrs . weston .  <eos>   there probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference ; mr . dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to miss campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds .  <eos>   when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs . weston , she found herself abruptly addressed with ,  <eos>   they were people whom her heart turned to very naturally .  <eos>   she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , miss woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her .  <eos>   " do come with me ," said mrs . weston , " if it be not very disagreeable to you .  <eos>   it did not often happen ; for mr . john knightley had really a great regard for his father - in - law , and generally a strong sense of what was due to him ; but it was too often for emma ' s charity , especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured , though the offence came not .  <eos>   something occurred while they were at hartfield , to make emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave .  <eos>   it had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands .  <eos>   so seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , i suppose , actually lost !  <eos>   " miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted ,"-- observed mrs . weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover .--" the expression of the eye is most correct , but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes .  <eos>   i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea - faring life can do ; but to a degree , i know it is the same with them all : they are all knocked about , and exposed to every climate , and every weather , till they are not fit to be seen .  <eos>
