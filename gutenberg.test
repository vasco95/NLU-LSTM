  she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations ; but it was not possible , that when within reach of captain wentworth ' s conversation with either of the miss musgroves , she should not try to hear it ; yet she caught little very remarkable .  <eos>   he feared there must be some decided involvement .  <eos>   he was not a great favourite with his fair sister - in - law .  <eos>   the house was cleared yesterday , except of the little harvilles ; but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home .  <eos>   you forget how time passes ."  <eos>   what have they brought you ?"  <eos>   must go and speak to dr . and mrs . hughes for a moment .-- how do you do ?  <eos>   " to a mrs . smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children .  <eos>   at last , and tolerably in his usual tone , he said ,  <eos>   " indifferent !  <eos>   supper was announced .  <eos>   anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now , to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character ; and whether it might not strike him that , like all other qualities of the mind , it should have its proportions and limits .  <eos>   and now , miss woodhouse , i do not think i shall mind seeing them again .  <eos>   i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but i hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners ."  <eos>   i dare say he has ; and though it may cut him off from some advantages , it will secure him many others ."  <eos>   ' tis a sad business ."  <eos>   first , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man ' s youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man .  <eos>   she will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older .  <eos>   i bring a new proposal on the subject :-- a thought of my father ' s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon .  <eos>   emma could not doubt .  <eos>   said mr . weston , looking about .  <eos>   " yes , papa , it is written out in our second page .  <eos>   this point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear emma ' s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- mrs . weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview .  <eos>   anne herself was become hardened to such affronts ; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell .  <eos>   for her own sake she could not be rude ; and for harriet ' s , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of mr . elton ' s nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to .  <eos>   he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner ; and having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books before him , mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right , and talked , with grave faces , of his studying himself to death .  <eos>   mr . knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew mr . elton looked up to him .  <eos>   " no , indeed , i shall grant you nothing .  <eos>   but that would not do .  <eos>   it was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see mr . knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit .  <eos>   he had gone away rejected and mortified -- disappointed in a very sanguine hope , after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement ; and not only losing the right lady , but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one .  <eos>   good old mrs . bates -- i will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children .-- they are always so pleased to see my children .-- and that excellent miss bates !-- such thorough worthy people !-- how are they , sir ?"  <eos>   " thank you , dear miss woodhouse , you are all kindness .-- it is impossible to say -- yes , indeed , i quite understand -- dearest jane ' s prospects -- that is , i do not mean .-- but she is charmingly recovered .-- how is mr .  <eos>   after a moment ' s pause , captain wentworth said --  <eos>   that i had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young martin .  <eos>   in spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear ?-- when the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .  <eos>   for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken .  <eos>   the unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father .  <eos>   her attention was now claimed by mr . woodhouse , who being , according to his custom on such occasions , making the circle of his guests , and paying his particular compliments to the ladies , was ending with her -- and with all his mildest urbanity , said ,  <eos>   ` but ,' said i , ` to be quite honest , i do not think i can live without something of a musical society .  <eos>   mr . weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation .  <eos>   " oh !"  <eos>   she was pleased , on taking leave , to find miss fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say ,  <eos>   he was devoted to henrietta ; always turning towards her ; and when he spoke at all , always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits .  <eos>   if you wish me to talk to mrs . hodges , or to inspect anything --"  <eos>   most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if elizabeth were his object ; and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while mr elliot ' s frequent visits were talked of .  <eos>   donwell was famous for its strawberry - beds , which seemed a plea for the invitation : but no plea was necessary ; cabbage - beds would have been enough to tempt the lady , who only wanted to be going somewhere .  <eos>   " and i am sure , sir ."  <eos>   she must laugh at such a close !  <eos>   she had not advanced many yards from mrs . goddard ' s door , when she was met by mr . elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid -- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to hartfield -- they were overtaken by mr . john knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for .  <eos>   another accidental meeting with the martins was possible , and in her present state , would be dangerous .  <eos>   he had hoped she would speak again , but she did not .  <eos>   " do come with me ," said mrs . weston , " if it be not very disagreeable to you .  <eos>   -- those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her .  <eos>   " had you ?"  <eos>   not to wait upon a bride is very remiss .  <eos>   in short , i can feel no dependence on his coming , and i wish mr . weston were less sanguine ."  <eos>   i absolutely cannot do without music .  <eos>   he thanked her , observing , " how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment !  <eos>   mrs croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person .  <eos>   charles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin ' s behaviour .  <eos>   but what is distance , mr . weston , to people of large fortune ?-- you would be amazed to hear how my brother , mr . suckling , sometimes flies about .  <eos>   you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest --.  <eos>   good morning to you , my dear sir .  <eos>   " thank you ," said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed .  <eos>   she was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that mrs . weston foretold .  <eos>   a little while ago , he was at weymouth .  <eos>   that it was time for every body to go , concluded the subject ; and with a short final arrangement for the next day ' s scheme , they parted .  <eos>   anne elliot , so young ; known to so few , to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune ; or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing , anxious , youth - killing dependence !  <eos>   " and i am sure , sir ."  <eos>   why was not she to be as useful as anne ?  <eos>   " emma , why is it that they are your enemies ?"  <eos>   the miss musgroves agreed to it ; and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could , they returned to the breakfast table .  <eos>   this little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before .  <eos>   the child of good fortune !  <eos>   that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents .  <eos>   but i can remember nothing ;-- not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention ; i can only recollect the first stanza ; and there are several .  <eos>   some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs . weston ' s drawing - room ;-- mr . elton must compose his joyous looks , and mr . john knightley disperse his ill - humour .  <eos>   she had a large acquaintance , of course professionally , among those who can afford to buy , and she disposes of my merchandise .  <eos>   the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own ; the servant in mourning roused anne ' s curiosity , and the whole six were collected to look , by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household , and taking his seat , to drive off .  <eos>   as to being anne ' s acquaintance ," said mary , " i think he is rather my acquaintance , for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight ."  <eos>   this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and mr . knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said ,  <eos>   every body is lazy !  <eos>   emma smiled and answered --" my visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , i hope ; but not even i can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed .  <eos>   she desired nothing better herself .  <eos>   i like old friends ; and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed .  <eos>   lady russell ' s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point , in her intercourse in camden place .  <eos>   yes ; he had done it .  <eos>   the churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through .  <eos>   but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present ."  <eos>   young and gentle as she was , it might yet have been possible to withstand her father ' s ill - will , though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister ; but lady russell , whom she had always loved and relied on , could not , with such steadiness of opinion , and such tenderness of manner , be continually advising her in vain .  <eos>   a fine open sea , he says , and very pure air .  <eos>   " i have been considering what we had best do .  <eos>   so you would all .  <eos>   and such a noble fire !-- i am quite roasted .  <eos>   i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them ."  <eos>   " she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there .  <eos>   it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other .  <eos>   he may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it ."  <eos>   a mind lively and at ease , can do with seeing nothing , and can see nothing that does not answer .  <eos>   if you value her conduct or happiness , infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can .  <eos>   " mr . knightley ' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr . martin with _him_ .  <eos>   she had been taken to charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight .  <eos>   in spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet , which mrs . weston had just gone through by herself .  <eos>   part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr . weston ' s on the subject , as much as possible .  <eos>   mr elliot , too , it must be remembered , had not been a widower seven months .  <eos>   i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you ."  <eos>   charming people , mr . and mrs . weston ;-- mrs . weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society ;-- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any .  <eos>   " it is as long again as almost all we have had before ."  <eos>   it was kindly said , and very far from giving offence .  <eos>   i speak as a friend , emma .  <eos>   cried the admiral , " what stuff these young fellows talk !  <eos>   i was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother ' s , it must have been a real indulgence ."  <eos>   and how beautiful we thought he looked !  <eos>   she believed every body spoke well of him .  <eos>   how do you do ?-- very well , i thank you .  <eos>   i have no fears at all for myself ; and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs . weston , but on your account .  <eos>   emma divined what every body present must be thinking .  <eos>   " i shall never let that book go out of my own hands ," said she .  <eos>   " there is no saying , indeed ," replied harriet rather solemnly .  <eos>   " it will be natural for me ," he added shortly afterwards , " to speak my opinion aloud as i read .  <eos>   i can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation .  <eos>   the walking party had crossed the lane , and were surmounting an opposite stile , and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again , when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister .  <eos>   that very dear part of emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply .  <eos>   such kind friends , you know , miss woodhouse , one must always find agreeable , though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning ' s party .  <eos>   " but it is proved by the smallness of the school , which i have heard you speak of , as under the patronage of your sister and mrs . bragge ; the only school , and not more than five - and - twenty children ."  <eos>   " it is not very likely , my dear , that bathing should have been of use to her -- and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation , i would have spoken to --  <eos>   that would have been too dreadful !-- what an escape !-- dear miss woodhouse , i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world ."  <eos>   for i think you have a little cold , and patty has been washing the kitchen .'--` oh !  <eos>   this was an article not to be entered on by himself ; but a very intimate friend of his , a colonel wallis , a highly respectable man , perfectly the gentleman , ( and not an ill - looking man , sir walter added ), who was living in very good style in marlborough buildings , and had , at his own particular request , been admitted to their acquaintance through mr elliot , had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage , which made a material difference in the discredit of it .  <eos>   she was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that mrs . weston foretold .  <eos>   they could not listen to her description of him .  <eos>   warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still .  <eos>   his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening .  <eos>   they want her ( mr . and mrs . dixon ) excessively to come over with colonel and mrs . campbell ; quite depend upon it ; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation , jane says , as you will hear presently ; mr . dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention .  <eos>   angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak .  <eos>   in this walk emma and mr . weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived mr . knightley and harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way .  <eos>   her brother ' s return was the first comfort ; he could take best care of his wife ; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary .  <eos>   just the trifling , silly fellow i took him for ."  <eos>   between ourselves , i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme as long as louisa ; it would have kept her a little out of his way .  <eos>   perry !-- such attention to jane !"  <eos>   as the head of the house , he felt that he ought to have been consulted , especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand ; " for they must have been seen together ," he observed , " once at tattersall ' s , and twice in the lobby of the house of commons ."  <eos>   " i do remember it ," cried emma ; " i perfectly remember it .-- talking about spruce - beer .-- oh !  <eos>   you want your neighbours ' opinions .  <eos>   mr . weston must be between forty and fifty ."  <eos>   dick had been left ill at gibraltar , with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth ."  <eos>   if jane does not get well soon , we will call in mr . perry .  <eos>   not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity ; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected .  <eos>   poor mr . elton !  <eos>   i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour , i assure you , be he sailor or soldier ."  <eos>   it is his companion all this evening , his solace , his delight .  <eos>   i have not always known their writing apart ."  <eos>   you may think , miss elliot , whether he is dear to us !"  <eos>   " i have always admired her complexion ," replied emma , archly ; " but do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale ?-- when we first began to talk of her .-- have you quite forgotten ?"  <eos>   " i must see captain benwick before i decide ," said lady russell , smiling .  <eos>   said i to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( sir basil morley ).  <eos>   miss bates ' s powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours ."  <eos>   she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ' s children ever were .  <eos>   " almost every moment .  <eos>   she is poor ; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to ; and , if she live to old age , must probably sink more .  <eos>   emma ' s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by harriet ' s being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least .  <eos>   she cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , " very well , mr . elton , very well indeed .  <eos>   so passed the first three weeks .  <eos>   they walked on .  <eos>   -- harriet ' s was --  <eos>   but -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ), to marry him !-- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind !-- look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her !-- it was most provoking .  <eos>   no !--( in an accent meant to be insinuating )-- i am sure you have seen and understood me ."  <eos>   miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last !  <eos>   " miss woodhouse ," said frank churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , " have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ?  <eos>   he was gone the next moment :-- after another moment ' s pause ,  <eos>   the compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to hartfield .  <eos>   the plan had reached this point , when anne , coming quietly down from louisa ' s room , could not but hear what followed , for the parlour door was open .  <eos>   " i am very much obliged to you ," said emma , laughing again .  <eos>   i thought it must be so .  <eos>   i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour .  <eos>   do not you think so ?"  <eos>   " what is it my dear friend ?  <eos>   you like news -- and i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you ."  <eos>   do try to find it out , miss woodhouse .  <eos>   it had no advantage of situation ; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor ; and , such as it was , there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes .-- emma ' s remark was --  <eos>   " they may be induced to go too .  <eos>   emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note .  <eos>   a mrs smith .  <eos>   mr . weston must be quiet , and every thing deliberately arranged .  <eos>   she had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of .  <eos>   they are very , very kind in their visits .  <eos>   it was the very event to engage those who talk most , the young and the low ; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news .  <eos>   but i never went beyond the streights , and never was in the west indies .  <eos>   no , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched .  <eos>   i am glad i did not think of it before .  <eos>   the same story and the same raptures were repeated , when the two girls came with their father , through the gloom of the evening , to make enquiries ; and mr musgrove , no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir , could add his confirmation and praise , and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off , and only be sorry to think that the cottage party , probably , would not like to leave the little boy , to give him the meeting .  <eos>   my friend robert could not resist .  <eos>   every door was now closed , the passage plan given up , and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again ; and with such good - will on frank churchill ' s part , that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple , was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten .  <eos>   he had left the country in consequence .  <eos>   she shewed it to me .  <eos>   emma , you are a great dreamer , i think ?"  <eos>   their dress had every advantage , their faces were rather pretty , their spirits extremely good , their manner unembarrassed and pleasant ; they were of consequence at home , and favourites abroad .  <eos>   i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere .  <eos>   the day at lyme , the fall from the cobb , might influence her health , her nerves , her courage , her character to the end of her life , as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate .  <eos>   " i had only my own family to study from .  <eos>   " you mistake me , you quite mistake me ," she replied , exerting herself .  <eos>   said mr . weston , looking about .  <eos>   i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to emma ,) a lady residing in or near highbury ; a family of the name of fairfax .  <eos>   " i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour .  <eos>   at the end of that period , lady russell ' s politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self - threatenings of the past became in a decided tone , " i must call on mrs croft ; i really must call upon her soon .  <eos>   anne ' s good - will , however , was not to be lessened by what she heard .  <eos>   " yes , sir , a mr elliot , a gentleman of large fortune , came in last night from sidmouth .  <eos>   two months must bring it to the proof .  <eos>   " my mother ' s deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all .  <eos>   " my dear emma , i have told you what led me to think of it .  <eos>   " oh no !  <eos>   at the end of that period , lady russell ' s politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self - threatenings of the past became in a decided tone , " i must call on mrs croft ; i really must call upon her soon .  <eos>   to be in company , nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed , to sit and smile and look pretty , and say nothing , was enough for the happiness of the present hour .  <eos>   what do you advise ?"  <eos>   captain wentworth , after being unseen and unheard of at uppercross for two whole days , appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away .  <eos>   my right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question .  <eos>   she could do little more than listen patiently , soften every grievance , and excuse each to the other ; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours , and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister ' s benefit .  <eos>   can it be neptune ?  <eos>   miss carteret , with still less to say , was so plain and so awkward , that she would never have been tolerated in camden place but for her birth .  <eos>   i want to puzzle you again ."  <eos>   mr . john knightley proved more talkative than his brother .  <eos>   " yes , very true .  <eos>   lady elliot had been an excellent woman , sensible and amiable ; whose judgement and conduct , if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot , had never required indulgence afterwards .-- she had humoured , or softened , or concealed his failings , and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years ; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself , had found enough in her duties , her friends , and her children , to attach her to life , and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them .  <eos>   your sister is an amiable creature ; but yours is the character of decision and firmness , i see .  <eos>   and the same may be said of mrs . jeffereys -- clara partridge , that was -- and of the two milmans , now mrs . bird and mrs . james cooper ; and of more than i can enumerate .  <eos>   there was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand ; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr . woodhouse good ."  <eos>   he looked at her , as if wanting to read her thoughts .  <eos>   he , who had ever boasted of being an elliot , and whose feelings , as to connection , were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day .  <eos>   the eltons walked together ; mr . knightley took charge of miss bates and jane ; and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill .  <eos>   there was not a baronet from a to z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal .  <eos>   " oh no ; as to leaving the little boy ," both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought ; and anne , in the joy of the escape , could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs .  <eos>   when she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there .  <eos>   and , by what i understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable .  <eos>   " very serious !  <eos>   ` the consequence ,' said she , ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought .  <eos>   you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other .  <eos>   perry ?-- has he been here this morning ?-- and how does he travel now ?-- has he set up his carriage ?"  <eos>   " you certainly will meet them if i can prevail ; and i shall call on miss bates in my way home ."  <eos>   it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood .  <eos>   and ever since she was twelve , emma has been mistress of the house and of you all .  <eos>   emma was sorry ;-- to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months !-- to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought !  <eos>   _miss_ _woodhouse_ appeared more than once , and never without a something of pleasing connexion , either a compliment to her taste , or a remembrance of what she had said ; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye , unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry , she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed .  <eos>   " nonsense !  <eos>   i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday , but the case is very different to - day ."  <eos>   has emma read it all ?  <eos>   " oh , no !  <eos>   " i shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places .  <eos>   anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent ; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it , from believing that , though there were on each side continual subjects of offence , neither family could now do without it .  <eos>   there was no end of miss elliot ' s charms ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before ."  <eos>   emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of mrs . elton ' s voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand .  <eos>   interrupted emma , " there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over .  <eos>   former provocations reappeared .  <eos>   " well ," said she at last , trying to recover herself ; " this is a circumstance which i must think of at least half a day , before i can at all comprehend it .  <eos>   but , fair or not fair , there are unbecoming conjunctions , which reason will patronize in vain -- which taste cannot tolerate -- which ridicule will seize .  <eos>   for the present , he could not be spared , to his " very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period ."  <eos>   i shall sit by you .  <eos>   what a thinking brain you have !  <eos>   i have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule .  <eos>   his acquittal was complete , his friendship warmly honoured , a lively interest excited for his friend , and his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to by the party , that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves , and a project for going thither was the consequence .  <eos>   " he has been here this very morning , on a most extraordinary errand .  <eos>   louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister .  <eos>   it soon appeared that london was not the place for her .  <eos>   but just got acquainted with mrs . weston , and others !-- i hate the recollection ."  <eos>   i see it in her cheek , her smile , her vain attempt to frown .  <eos>   " but they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much .  <eos>   --  <eos>   mrs . weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfax !-- well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ), this is all to be forgotten .  <eos>   his face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered .  <eos>   a conundrum of mr . weston ' s shall clear him and his next neighbour .  <eos>   the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream , was perhaps the most prominent feeling .  <eos>   " we are going to box hill to - morrow ;-- you will join us .  <eos>   mrs . elton had most kindly sent jane a note , or we should have been .-- but two such offers in one day !-- never were such neighbours .  <eos>   no , now i recollect , now i have it ; something happened before tea , but not that .  <eos>   when i am quite determined as to the time , i am not at all afraid of being long unemployed .  <eos>   chapter viii  <eos>   " the admiralty ," he continued , " entertain themselves now and then , with sending a few hundred men to sea , in a ship not fit to be employed .  <eos>   no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern ; it was the language of real feeling towards mrs . weston ; and the transition from highbury to enscombe , the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt , and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety .-- the charm of her own name was not wanting .  <eos>   " well ," said emma , " i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea , and i wish them very happy .  <eos>   " my dearest harriet !"  <eos>   the difference of harriet at mrs . goddard ' s , or in london , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emma ' s sensations ; but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself .  <eos>   one could not leave her out ."  <eos>   what was his name ?  <eos>   but mary did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an elliot , or from not wanting to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed .  <eos>   " yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and i must be off immediately .  <eos>   emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby ,  <eos>   my dear , it is not like hartfield .  <eos>   a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities , or neither .  <eos>   her intentions were unchanged .  <eos>   such an aunt !"  <eos>   their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after .  <eos>   .  <eos>   if she could not have been angry with frank churchill too , it would have been dreadful .-- as for jane fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account .  <eos>   do not let me lose it .  <eos>   it was a right thing to do .  <eos>   there was merit in every drawing -- in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same .  <eos>   i assure you , jane fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than i can express ."  <eos>   emma scarcely heard what was said .-- her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about miss fairfax ; and poor harriet ;-- and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation .  <eos>   said mrs musgrove to mrs croft .  <eos>   " dear me !  <eos>   ` old fellow !'  <eos>   she had great pleasure in hearing frank churchill talked of ; and , for his sake , greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr . and mrs . weston ; she was very often thinking of him , and quite impatient for a letter , that she might know how he was , how were his spirits , how was his aunt , and what was the chance of his coming to randalls again this spring .  <eos>   but sometimes of an evening , before we went to cards , he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts , very entertaining .  <eos>   " yes ," he replied , and without the smallest apparent embarrassment .-- " but they would have done better had they given her notice of it .  <eos>   is he coming , louisa ?"  <eos>   " ah !"  <eos>   she introduced him to her friend , miss smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other .  <eos>   there had been music , singing , talking , laughing , all that was most agreeable ; charming manners in captain wentworth , no shyness or reserve ; they seemed all to know each other perfectly , and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with charles .  <eos>   but a week must pass ; only a week , in anne ' s reckoning , and then , she supposed , they must meet ; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week .  <eos>   actually resolve to break with him entirely !-- she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each -- she dissolved it .-- what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour !-- well , he must be a most extraordinary --"  <eos>   i certainly have been misunderstanding you , if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer .  <eos>   from thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of mrs musgrove ' s who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying --  <eos>   he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do .  <eos>   for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual .-- you might not have distinguished how i came , by my look or manner ."  <eos>   mrs . elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures .  <eos>   it is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to ."  <eos>   " such an eye !-- the true hazle eye -- and so brilliant !  <eos>   she had nothing to wish otherwise , but that the days did not pass so swiftly .  <eos>   it had been begun several days back .  <eos>   it is what we happily have never known any thing of ; but it must be a life of misery .  <eos>   what am i to do ?"  <eos>   mrs . weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfax !-- well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ), this is all to be forgotten .  <eos>   i wanted them to put off the wedding ."  <eos>   how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates ?  <eos>   that is the key to a great deal of capacity .  <eos>   so silly -- so satisfied -- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious -- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , i would marry to - morrow .  <eos>   we never were so long without seeing her before , and as i was telling mrs . cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now ."  <eos>   but we never did .  <eos>   he cannot want money -- he cannot want leisure .  <eos>   if there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment .  <eos>   in the few minutes ' conversation which she had yet had with him , while harriet had been partially insensible , he had spoken of her terror , her naivete , her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm , with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at last , after harriet ' s own account had been given , he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms .  <eos>   to those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent .  <eos>   dear mrs . elton , so obliged to you for the carriage !-- excellent time .  <eos>   one man ' s ways may be as good as another ' s , but we all like our own best .  <eos>   something occurred while they were at hartfield , to make emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave .  <eos>   a short period of exquisite felicity followed , and but a short one .  <eos>   my wife should have the credit of them , however .  <eos>   " will he , indeed ?  <eos>   charles heard it quite by chance ; they have not had the civility to give me any notice , or of offering to take anything .  <eos>   with him it was most unnatural .  <eos>   this was the occurrence :-- the coles had been settled some years in highbury , and were very good sort of people -- friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel .  <eos>   husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain .  <eos>   mr . knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye -- he seemed watching her intently -- in vain , however , if it were so -- jane passed between them into the hall , and looked at neither .  <eos>   one cannot creep upon a journey ; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one ' s friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs ."  <eos>   harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till mr . elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess .  <eos>   emma must submit to stand second to mrs . elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .  <eos>   then , said i , i must run across , i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party , she cannot refuse .--` aye , pray do ,' said mr . frank churchill , ` miss woodhouse ' s opinion of the instrument will be worth having .'  <eos>   she was sorry , very sorry .  <eos>   when people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , miss woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and mr . suckling is extremely fond of exploring .  <eos>   and as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man i know .  <eos>   there is an anxiety , a curiosity in what one feels for emma .  <eos>   " here is his answer , if you like to see it ."  <eos>   " he is a rear admiral of the white .  <eos>   her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma ; but her words , every body ' s words , were soon lost under the incessant flow of miss bates , who came in talking , and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire .  <eos>   " i do not ask whether you are musical , mrs . elton .  <eos>   her looks and words had nothing to restrain them .  <eos>   " i hope ," said he presently , " i have not been severe upon poor mrs . churchill .  <eos>   you persuaded her to refuse him ."  <eos>   had the same behaviour continued , miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views ; not being aware , probably , any more than myself , of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of .  <eos>   here is the rivet of your mistress ' s spectacles out .  <eos>   referring the education to her seemed to imply it .  <eos>   but i thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned .  <eos>   she tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all .  <eos>   " yes , here i am , sophia , quite ready to make a foolish match .  <eos>   " he had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors ."  <eos>   " not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater .  <eos>   i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well .  <eos>   had you not been surrounded by other friends , i might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct .-- i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent ."  <eos>   frank churchill had danced once at highbury , and longed to dance again ; and the last half - hour of an evening which mr . woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls , was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject .  <eos>   little charles does not mind a word i say , and walter is growing quite as bad ."  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   she wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated .  <eos>   miss fairfax must already have given her account .-- i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow ."  <eos>   " indeed !  <eos>   however , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother ' s time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here .  <eos>   she felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference , and especially the attention of all the young women , could do .  <eos>   said jane , shaking her head ; " dear mrs . elton , who can have thought of it as i have done ?"  <eos>   if he were , he would have done this differently .  <eos>   i always deserve the best treatment , because i never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer .  <eos>   i never saw such a likeness in my life .  <eos>   we admired it so much , that i have ventured to write it into miss smith ' s collection .  <eos>   she was so wretched and so vehement , complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of anne ; anne , who was nothing to louisa , while she was her sister , and had the best right to stay in henrietta ' s stead !  <eos>   she and the children might stay very well ."  <eos>   i think you understand me , therefore ."  <eos>   chapter iv  <eos>   said emma , as soon as she could speak .  <eos>   how directly , how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject !-- not too strongly for the offence -- but far , far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear - sighted goodwill .-- she had no hope , nothing to deserve the name of hope , that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question ; but there was a hope ( at times a slight one , at times much stronger ,) that harriet might have deceived herself , and be overrating his regard for _her_ .-- wish it she must , for his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself , but his remaining single all his life .  <eos>   " do come with me ," said mrs . weston , " if it be not very disagreeable to you .  <eos>   but i kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as i dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment ."  <eos>   charles wonders what captain wentworth will say ; but if you remember , i never thought him attached to louisa ; i never could see anything of it .  <eos>   captain wentworth had no fortune .  <eos>   you must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross , which , as you well know , affords little to write about .  <eos>   how well she looked last night !"  <eos>   the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of , and the usual observations made .  <eos>   " i shall never be invited to abbey - mill again ," was said in rather a sorrowful tone .  <eos>   mr elliot was better to look at than most men , and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere ."  <eos>   he was immediately interested .  <eos>   emma found that it was not mr . weston ' s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger .  <eos>   can i do any thing for you ?"  <eos>   mr . woodhouse taken from hartfield !-- no , he felt that it ought not to be attempted .  <eos>   her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .  <eos>   it would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place .  <eos>   the confession completely renewed her first shame -- and the sight of harriet ' s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again .  <eos>   had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now ."  <eos>   you seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement .-- and mrs . churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion .  <eos>   i met her frequently at weymouth .  <eos>   " when i talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years ," said john knightley , " i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings .  <eos>   in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings ; but one complete dinner engagement , and out of the house too , there was no avoiding , though at christmas .  <eos>   i will tell you exactly what i think ."  <eos>   the only thing i do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold ."  <eos>   the listeners were amused ; and mrs . weston gave emma a look of particular meaning .  <eos>   " no , ma ' am , he did not mention no particular family ; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman , and would be a baronight some day ."  <eos>   " and who is admiral croft ?"  <eos>   " no , indeed -- _we_ are not at all in a bad air .  <eos>   volume iii  <eos>   " mrs . gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing -- miss smith ."  <eos>   she remembered what mr . knightley had once said to her about mr . elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that mr . elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself .  <eos>   we had not been six hours in the sound , when a gale came on , which lasted four days and nights , and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time ; our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition .  <eos>   " me !"  <eos>   " knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith !-- very goodnatured , i declare ."  <eos>   " miss elliot , i am sure you are tired ," cried mrs croft .  <eos>   she had not time to know how mr . elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for mr . john knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to mr . woodhouse :  <eos>   i have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her , while i go in and break it to mr and mrs musgrove .  <eos>   " these are the sights , harriet , to do one good .  <eos>   when he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind .  <eos>   these convictions must unquestionably have their own pain , and severe was its kind ; but they precluded that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again , and returning through the well - known apartments .  <eos>   " _i_ sick of prosperity and indulgence !  <eos>   i never compliment .  <eos>   so i said i would go down and see , and jane said , ` shall i go down instead ?  <eos>   i do not want to say more than is necessary -- i am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done , and i dare say you understand me ."  <eos>   but you know they were your own words , that _more_ wonderful things had happened , matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than between mr . frank churchill and me ; and , therefore , it seems as if such a thing even as this , may have occurred before -- and if i should be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to -- if mr . knightley should really -- if _he_ does not mind the disparity , i hope , dear miss woodhouse , you will not set yourself against it , and try to put difficulties in the way .  <eos>   in mourning , you see , just as our mr elliot must be .  <eos>   a small house in their own neighbourhood , where they might still have lady russell ' s society , still be near mary , and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch , was the object of her ambition .  <eos>   he told her the news .  <eos>   she had left the instrument on the dancing being over , and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss musgroves an idea of .  <eos>   i wish i had looked at him more .  <eos>   it is the fault of her face that she has them not ."  <eos>   she was sure that he had not been happy in marriage .  <eos>   mr . churchill , oh !  <eos>   with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever .  <eos>   phoo !"  <eos>   i did not see you before .  <eos>   jane had come to highbury professedly for three months ; the campbells were gone to ireland for three months ; but now the campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer , and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there .  <eos>   she was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all .  <eos>   miss nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about mr . elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , " that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom mr . elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , mr . elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness ."  <eos>   a good place is not it ?  <eos>   charming people , mr . and mrs . weston ;-- mrs . weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society ;-- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any .  <eos>   the carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage ;-- one morning , i remember , he came to me quite in despair ."  <eos>   mr . elton was to take the drawing to london , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough .  <eos>   it could not be otherwise .  <eos>   she talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for emma ' s attention ; it was soon gone to brunswick square or to donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when mrs . weston ended with , " we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but i hope it will soon come ," she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for .  <eos>   .  <eos>   if any thing could increase her delight , it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps .  <eos>   never was a better sloop than the asp in her day .  <eos>   " some very fine morning , he , and emma , and harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with mrs . weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens .  <eos>   there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort .  <eos>   elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally .  <eos>   a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands .  <eos>   but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny .  <eos>   " i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject ," replied emma , smiling ; " but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ?"  <eos>   emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr . weston depended , and felt , that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity .  <eos>   cried mr . john knightley , hearing his own name .  <eos>   chapter xvi  <eos>   miss bates was obliged to return without success ; jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse .-- emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let miss woodhouse in .  <eos>   it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way .  <eos>   " i have the greatest pleasure , my dear emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed .  <eos>   i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; " don ' t do this ," and " don ' t do that ;" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them ."  <eos>   " i am happy you approved ," said emma , smiling ; " but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield ."  <eos>   mr . elton and i are very good friends , and nothing more ;" and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel .  <eos>   your views for harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have ;-- and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man , i think it will be all labour in vain ."  <eos>   every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month .  <eos>   emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr . weston depended , and felt , that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity .  <eos>   who could have seen through such thick - headed nonsense ?  <eos>   " if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill , i have heard that already ."  <eos>   more is avowedly due to _her_ .  <eos>   did you ever hear any thing so strange ?  <eos>   charade .  <eos>   if he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , i dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had .  <eos>   and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk ."  <eos>   " i either depend more upon emma ' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for i cannot lament the acquaintance .  <eos>   why does not he try bath ?-- indeed he should .  <eos>   he had been in bath about a fortnight ; ( he had passed through bath in november , in his way to london , when the intelligence of sir walter ' s being settled there had of course reached him , though only twenty - four hours in the place , but he had not been able to avail himself of it ;) but he had now been a fortnight in bath , and his first object on arriving , had been to leave his card in camden place , following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet , and when they did meet , by such great openness of conduct , such readiness to apologize for the past , such solicitude to be received as a relation again , that their former good understanding was completely re - established .  <eos>   she looked down the randalls road .  <eos>   we shall not be many , you know ."  <eos>   " me !"  <eos>   every body knows what is due to _you_ ."  <eos>   he almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do ."  <eos>   henrietta fully thought so herself , before captain wentworth came ; but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten .  <eos>   i am always watching her to admire ; and i do pity her from my heart ."  <eos>   it was all read , however , steadily , attentively , and without the smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving pain -- no remembrance of box hill seemed to exist .  <eos>   elton was sitting here , i remember , much about where i am now ."  <eos>   mr elliot was in bath .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt , of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry ; the pleasure of looking at somebody new ; the gala - day to highbury entire , which the sight of him would have made ; and ending with reflections on the churchills again , found herself directly involved in a disagreement with mr . knightley ; and , to her great amusement , perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion , and making use of mrs . weston ' s arguments against herself .  <eos>   she was not thoroughly comfortable herself .  <eos>   poor mr . woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming , and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride .-- could he have seen the heart , he would have cared very little for the lungs ; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil , without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either , he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr . perry , and talked on with much self - contentment , totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return .  <eos>   and then not to find him at home !  <eos>   i wish you had been with us yesterday , for then you might have decided between us ; and i am sure you would have thought as i did , unless you had been determined to give it against me ."  <eos>   -- here was a sly glance at emma .  <eos>   no , it was not regret which made anne ' s heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free .  <eos>   oh !-- you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for mr . weston has told me himself .  <eos>   after attending louisa through her business , and loitering about a little longer , they returned to the inn ; and anne , in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining - room , had nearly run against the very same gentleman , as he came out of an adjoining apartment .  <eos>   her own spirits improved by change of place and subject , by being removed three miles from kellynch ; mary ' s ailments lessened by having a constant companion , and their daily intercourse with the other family , since there was neither superior affection , confidence , nor employment in the cottage , to be interrupted by it , was rather an advantage .  <eos>   miss nash , head - teacher at mrs . goddard ' s , had written out at least three hundred ; and harriet , who had taken the first hint of it from her , hoped , with miss woodhouse ' s help , to get a great many more .  <eos>   now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but i cannot stay to hear it ."  <eos>   and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one ; her judgement , on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against mr elliot .  <eos>   " a knock at the door !  <eos>   he had been going to call on them .  <eos>   i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony ."  <eos>   in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world ; and mr and mrs musgrove ' s fond partiality for their own daughters ' performance , and total indifference to any other person ' s , gave her much more pleasure for their sakes , than mortification for her own .  <eos>   he felt it all , so much for her sake .  <eos>   the wants and sufferings of the poor family , however , were the first subject on meeting .  <eos>   he told patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for mrs . hodges _would_ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder .  <eos>   jane was quite longing to go to ireland , from his account of things ."  <eos>   this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him .  <eos>   " indifferent !  <eos>   " yes ; if you and mr . woodhouse see no objection , and i trust you cannot , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there .  <eos>   " you cannot see too much perfection in mrs . weston for my feelings ," said emma ; " were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ , i should listen with pleasure ; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words .  <eos>   emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- a number of embarrassing recollections on each side .  <eos>   well !"  <eos>   when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about !  <eos>   i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury , as they can be to see her .  <eos>   there i was quite right .  <eos>   i have heard so much in praise of mr . frank churchill .-- at the same time it is fair to observe , that i am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others .  <eos>   he was very much pleased with randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to highbury , highbury itself , hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one ' s _own_ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it .  <eos>   only think of those sweet verses --` to miss --------.'  <eos>   " i have not a fault to find with her person ," he replied .  <eos>   at this moment i cannot recollect his name , though i have heard it so lately .  <eos>   they went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times .  <eos>   if she were to meet miss bates in her way !-- and upon its beginning to rain , emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at mrs . goddard ' s , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation .  <eos>   she was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good , yet was still unwilling to be away , till , touched by the thought of her father and mother , she gave it up ; she consented , she was anxious to be at home .  <eos>   were you often in the same society ?"  <eos>   if it can be contrived to be at the crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses .  <eos>   the aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in mr . weston ' s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   to the great house accordingly they went , to sit the full half hour in the old - fashioned square parlour , with a small carpet and shining floor , to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano - forte and a harp , flower - stands and little tables placed in every direction .  <eos>   mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over .  <eos>   no , indeed !  <eos>   he had left the country in consequence .  <eos>   she must tell you herself what she is -- yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit .-- since i began this letter , which will be longer than i foresaw , i have heard from her .-- she gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , i dare not depend .  <eos>   " yes , to be sure , i suppose there are .  <eos>   they all met , and were introduced .  <eos>   " such an extraordinary dream of mine !"  <eos>   --  <eos>   i want you to call me something else , but i do not know what ."  <eos>   indeed , i must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better .  <eos>   anne did not shrink from it ; on the contrary , she truly felt as she said , in observing --  <eos>   matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter ' s marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse told me of it .  <eos>   " so , you are come at last !  <eos>   but she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before .  <eos>   she could determine nothing at present .  <eos>   she has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself .  <eos>   the father and mother were in the old english style , and the young people in the new .  <eos>   invite them both ."  <eos>   he had always been lucky ; he knew he should be so still .  <eos>   i declare i had no idea !  <eos>   something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know -- there is a sad story against them , in general .  <eos>   her feelings made her speak low ; and captain wentworth , hearing only in part , and probably not having dick musgrove at all near his thoughts , looked rather in suspense , and as if waiting for more .  <eos>   if he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch , he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree .  <eos>   you must not run away from us now .  <eos>   in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one ."  <eos>   if you were to see what a headache she has .  <eos>   she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment .  <eos>   emma could not resist .  <eos>   to look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation .  <eos>   how do you all do ?-- quite well , i am much obliged to you .  <eos>   mrs . perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed .  <eos>   when once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim .  <eos>   i grant you , that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta , and indeed it could not be ; he is the only one that could be possible ; but he is a very good - natured , good sort of a fellow ; and whenever winthrop comes into his hands , he will make a different sort of place of it , and live in a very different sort of way ; and with that property , he will never be a contemptible man -- good , freehold property .  <eos>   " you mean to return a favourable answer , i collect ."  <eos>   you are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference ."  <eos>   she had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought .  <eos>   " donwell !"  <eos>   no -- i would get you a better partner than myself .  <eos>   mr . elton was to take the drawing to london , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough .  <eos>   blessed with so many resources within myself , the world was not necessary to _me_ .  <eos>   i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs . cole told us of it at dinner ."  <eos>   when she could let her attention take its natural course again , she found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list ( their own navy list , the first that had ever been at uppercross ), and sitting down together to pore over it , with the professed view of finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded .  <eos>   " good heaven !"  <eos>   they think charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell , and that therefore , she persuaded anne to refuse him ."  <eos>   " but there may be pretty good guessing .  <eos>   you must have heard him notice mrs clay ' s freckles ."  <eos>   " it would not be a great match for henrietta , but charles has a very fair chance , through the spicers , of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two ; and you will please to remember , that he is the eldest son ; whenever my uncle dies , he steps into very pretty property .  <eos>   you clever creature , that ' s very true .  <eos>   anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance ; but still , saved as we all are , by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange , she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments ; and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together , that good - humoured mutual affection , of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters .  <eos>   those who can barely live , and who live perforce in a very small , and generally very inferior , society , may well be illiberal and cross .  <eos>   anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , charles taking care of his sister , and captain benwick attending to her .  <eos>   " and what are we to do for a proper partner for her ?"  <eos>   " but i have never fixed on june or any other month -- merely looked forward to the summer in general ."  <eos>   poor mr . woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer .  <eos>   she has not the least idea ."  <eos>   it would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of miss smith ' s ."  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   campbell ."  <eos>   he came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it .  <eos>   i wish we had been aware in time , who it was , that he might have been introduced to us .  <eos>   how low it makes me !"  <eos>   " and i am changed also ; for i am now very willing to grant you all harriet ' s good qualities .  <eos>   mr . knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye -- he seemed watching her intently -- in vain , however , if it were so -- jane passed between them into the hall , and looked at neither .  <eos>   he certainly might have heard mr . elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and mr . elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , mr . knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives .  <eos>   " you know i always cure you when i come .  <eos>   i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr . woodhouse good ."  <eos>   " now , this must be very bad for you ," said he , suddenly rousing from a little reverie , " to be coming and finding us here .  <eos>   " i hope ," said he presently , " i have not been severe upon poor mrs . churchill .  <eos>   frank churchill came back again ; and if he kept his father ' s dinner waiting , it was not known at hartfield ; for mrs . weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr . woodhouse , to betray any imperfection which could be concealed .  <eos>   her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman ."  <eos>   i know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together ; and i laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray ."  <eos>   " emma , my love , you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy ; but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected .  <eos>   they are but too apt to give up music ."  <eos>   we had not been six hours in the sound , when a gale came on , which lasted four days and nights , and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time ; our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition .  <eos>   " read it , read it ," said he , " it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to emma ."  <eos>   i should have visited admiral croft , however , at any rate .  <eos>   i like a job of that sort excessively .'  <eos>   my dear admiral , that post !  <eos>   and such a noble fire !-- i am quite roasted .  <eos>   neither more nor less than his being in love with louisa , and not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer from mr musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by captain harville .  <eos>   mrs . elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope , smiled most graciously .  <eos>   " but , could you be comfortable yourself , to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy ?"  <eos>   the husband had not been what he ought , and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved .  <eos>   get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it ."  <eos>   but she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and elizabeth .  <eos>   she was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing - room , the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby , under the influence of four summers and two children ; and , on anne ' s appearing , greeted her with --  <eos>   they continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of miss campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of mr . dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn .  <eos>   mrs . weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem .  <eos>   " i am glad you approve of what i have done ," said he very comfortably .  <eos>   " no , ma ' am , he did not mention no particular family ; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman , and would be a baronight some day ."  <eos>   strangers filling their place !"  <eos>   they could think of no one else .  <eos>   for thirteen years had she been doing the honours , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing - rooms and dining - rooms in the country .  <eos>   do you think it will look well ?"  <eos>   " your feelings are singular .  <eos>   " i should not have thought it possible ," she began , " that you could have misunderstood me !  <eos>   after a moment ' s pause , captain wentworth said --  <eos>   she had thought only of avoiding captain wentworth ; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening .  <eos>   mr . weston , do not mistake me .  <eos>   but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do .  <eos>   his importance at enscombe was very evident .  <eos>   charles and henrietta returned , bringing , as may be conjectured , charles hayter with them .  <eos>   as an old friend , you will allow me to hope , miss fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have ."  <eos>   emma smiled and answered --" my visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , i hope ; but not even i can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed .  <eos>   " he trifles here ," said he , " as to the temptation .  <eos>   harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate .-- it might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke .  <eos>   " he wrote a letter to poor mrs . weston , to congratulate her , and a very proper , handsome letter it was .  <eos>   " if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , i would send her a new hat and pelisse ."  <eos>   but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism .  <eos>   if she does wrong , she ought to feel it ."  <eos>   i think you play quite as well as she does .  <eos>   the style of the visit , and the shortness of it , were then felt to be decisive .  <eos>   we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a something more early implanted .  <eos>   to be constantly living with an ill - tempered person , must be dreadful .  <eos>   " that may be , and i may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name .  <eos>   " the crown !"  <eos>   we are not asked to dine with them , however , till the day after , mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey , which is not very likely , considering the care that will be taken of her ; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to - morrow .  <eos>   " do you mean that she refused him ?"  <eos>   poor dear jane was talking of it just now .-- ` you must go ,' said she .  <eos>   he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow .  <eos>   mr . weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man ' s company .  <eos>   my dear , i wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass .  <eos>   woodhouse , who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined even by him , stirred no more ; and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that mrs . weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need .  <eos>   ma ' am ," addressing her , " do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane ' s handwriting ?"  <eos>   she might do very well by herself .  <eos>   " mr . frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively ."  <eos>   how long had mr . knightley been so dear to her , as every feeling declared him now to be ?  <eos>   campbell ."  <eos>   " my dear mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself !  <eos>   " well , well , means to make her an offer then .  <eos>   _her_ connexions may be worse than _his_ .  <eos>   on another ,  <eos>   mrs . weston again , and again , and again , you see .  <eos>   charles came a few hours afterwards , to bring a later and more particular account .  <eos>   the sight of mrs clay in such favour , and of anne so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   she hardly wished to have more leisure for them .  <eos>   i do congratulate you , mrs . weston , most warmly .  <eos>   " i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet , to be tempted ; mr . elton , you know , ( recollecting herself ,) is out of the question : and i do _not_ wish to see any such person .  <eos>   have not i some right to complain ?  <eos>   anne ' s shudderings were to herself alone ; but the miss musgroves could be as open as they were sincere , in their exclamations of pity and horror .  <eos>   " but i ," he soon added , " who have had no such charm thrown over my senses , must still see , hear , and remember .  <eos>   " harriet , poor harriet !"  <eos>   " yes , mr . dixon and miss campbell were the persons ; and i thought it a very strong proof ."  <eos>   " very well .  <eos>   if he were , he would have done this differently .  <eos>   i hope you are quite well .  <eos>   it would have surprised anne if louisa could have readily answered such a speech : words of such interest , spoken with such serious warmth !  <eos>   emma would be " very happy to wait on mrs . bates , & c .," and they did at last move out of the shop , with no farther delay from miss bates than ,  <eos>   she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered -- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up .-- the house was larger than hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms .-- it was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding .-- some faults of temper john knightley had ; but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably .  <eos>   most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if elizabeth were his object ; and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while mr elliot ' s frequent visits were talked of .  <eos>   miss woodhouse , must you be going ?-- you seem but just come -- so very obliging of you ."  <eos>   " and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy ?-- the campbells , the dixons , did none of them know of the engagement ?"  <eos>   " i remember once calling you ` george ,' in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago .  <eos>   if you want any farther explanation ," continued he , smiling , " they are paid for it .  <eos>   and as for james , you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls , because of his daughter ' s being housemaid there .  <eos>   pray , pray attempt it .  <eos>   the good bateses -- i am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters .  <eos>   she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood -- and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half .  <eos>   i should be unwilling , i own , to live in any other part of the town ;-- there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in : but _we_ are so remarkably airy !-- mr .  <eos>   emma was in no danger of forgetting .  <eos>   a thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her .-- if you think me in a way to be happier than i deserve , i am quite of your opinion .-- miss w . calls me the child of good fortune .  <eos>   i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life ."  <eos>   and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody -- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the campbells , may it not be from mr . knightley ?  <eos>   i am sure i was very much surprized when i first heard she was going to be married ."  <eos>   " well ," said mrs . elton , laughing , " we shall see ."  <eos>   a chaise was sent for from crewkherne , and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery - maid of the family , one who having brought up all the children , and seen the very last , the lingering and long - petted master harry , sent to school after his brothers , was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her , and who , consequently , was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa .  <eos>   harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father ' s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   " i do not know what i could imagine , but i confess that i have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .  <eos>   ."  <eos>   emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self - willed , and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest .  <eos>   mr . weston is rather an easy , cheerful - tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , i suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords ."  <eos>   it will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be ."  <eos>   i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove .  <eos>   " how d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- we have been sitting with your father -- glad to see him so well .  <eos>   mrs . weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject .  <eos>   chapter viii  <eos>   the older a person grows , harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   in no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance .  <eos>   " it is very unfair to judge of any body ' s conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation .  <eos>   and no apology left , no message for me .  <eos>   " it is certainly very well regulated ."  <eos>   how do you all do ?-- quite well , i am much obliged to you .  <eos>   could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot , could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on , have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness !  <eos>   few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did , nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society .  <eos>   there was so much of friendliness , and of flattery , and of everything most bewitching in his reception there ; the old were so hospitable , the young so agreeable , that he could not but resolve to remain where he was , and take all the charms and perfections of edward ' s wife upon credit a little longer .  <eos>   she and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely , and in the evening we went to ask her how she did , when we were rather surprised not to find captain benwick of the party , for he had been invited as well as the harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ?  <eos>   captain wentworth turned in to call on his friend ; the others walked on , and he was to join them on the cobb .  <eos>   it was all read , however , steadily , attentively , and without the smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving pain -- no remembrance of box hill seemed to exist .  <eos>   i shall never forget his happiness .  <eos>   we really must wish you good night ."  <eos>   now emma could , indeed , enjoy mr . knightley ' s visits ; now she could talk , and she could listen with true happiness , unchecked by that sense of injustice , of guilt , of something most painful , which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her , how much might at that moment , and at a little distance , be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself .  <eos>   _her_ connexions may be worse than _his_ .  <eos>   emma had no longer an alarm for henry ; his interest was yet safe ; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment .  <eos>   ` i did not make the allowances ,' said she , ` which i ought to have done , for his temper and spirits -- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , i am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first .'  <eos>   mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the admiral ' s family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant .  <eos>   mr . woodhouse was fond of society in his own way .  <eos>   oh !  <eos>   she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault .  <eos>   there was no getting at her real opinion .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   " aye , that will be much best ," said harriet , quite satisfied , " i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs .  <eos>   _what_ she was , must be uncertain ; but _who_ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the , l ., it did not appear that she was at all harriet ' s superior .  <eos>   a little while ago , every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at mr . cole ' s , or balls at the crown .  <eos>   " i have reason to think ," he replied , " that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter :-- robert martin is the man .  <eos>   miss fairfax , you must not run such risks .-- liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year .  <eos>   her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _her_ .  <eos>   fetch miss bates .  <eos>   lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all , wondered , grieved , and feared ; and the affront it contained to anne , in mrs clay ' s being of so much use , while anne could be of none , was a very sore aggravation .  <eos>   emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the " very true , my love ," which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all .  <eos>   they should lose her ; and , probably , in great measure , her husband also .-- frank churchill would return among them no more ; and miss fairfax , it was reasonable to suppose , would soon cease to belong to highbury .  <eos>   but really , i could almost venture , if harriet would sit to me .  <eos>   intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question .  <eos>   " you may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together ," said jane , " they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me .  <eos>   mr . elton was only too happy .  <eos>   long before he reappeared , attending the short , neat , brisk - moving aunt , and her elegant niece ,-- mrs . weston , like a sweet - tempered woman and a good wife , had examined the passage again , and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before -- indeed very trifling ; and here ended the difficulties of decision .  <eos>   " well , if he have nothing else to recommend him , he will be a treasure at highbury .  <eos>   it will be some trial to us both ."  <eos>   that , you know , was so very .  <eos>   their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father .  <eos>   " true .  <eos>   i was snowed up at a friend ' s house once for a week .  <eos>   the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread ; and mr . weston had his five minutes share of it ; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind .-- he saw the advantages of the match , and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife ; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing ; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it .  <eos>   at last jane began , and though the first bars were feebly given , the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to .  <eos>   " how do you like mrs .  <eos>   this event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning .  <eos>   why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room ?-- she who could do any thing in highbury !  <eos>   chapter  <eos>   he proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , i was convinced he could not do better .  <eos>   --  <eos>   " she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one ' s eyes from .  <eos>   she is dead !"  <eos>   she was so wretched and so vehement , complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of anne ; anne , who was nothing to louisa , while she was her sister , and had the best right to stay in henrietta ' s stead !  <eos>   it was soon drawn , perforce another way .  <eos>   mr . knightley does nothing mysteriously ."  <eos>   the want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied .  <eos>   his good friend perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter .  <eos>   she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself .  <eos>   you do not know how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations .  <eos>   little henry was in her thoughts , and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say .  <eos>   oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day ."  <eos>   yes , i must be there ; i could not refuse ; and i will keep as much awake as i can ; but i would rather be at home , looking over william larkins ' s week ' s account ; much rather , i confess .-- pleasure in seeing dancing !-- not i , indeed -- i never look at it -- i do not know who does .-- fine dancing , i believe , like virtue , must be its own reward .  <eos>   i remember her telling me at the ball , that i owed mrs . elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax .-- i hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss .  <eos>   suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us ?"  <eos>   " i did not mean , i was not thinking of the slave - trade ," replied jane ; " governess - trade , i assure you , was all that i had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , i do not know where it lies .  <eos>   " and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy ?-- the campbells , the dixons , did none of them know of the engagement ?"  <eos>   she had frequently thought -- especially since his father ' s marriage with miss taylor -- that if she _were_ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition .  <eos>   she felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference , and especially the attention of all the young women , could do .  <eos>   is not that your idea ?"  <eos>   " it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it ," said the young man , " though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far ; but in coming _home_ i felt i might do any thing ."  <eos>   without partiality ; but mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated --!  <eos>   i will call another day , and hear the pianoforte ."  <eos>   what are we to do ?-- the year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done .  <eos>   " poor mrs . churchill !  <eos>   it stood the record of many sensations of pain , once severe , but now softened ; and of some instances of relenting feeling , some breathings of friendship and reconciliation , which could never be looked for again , and which could never cease to be dear .  <eos>   thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall , presiding and directing with a self - possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was .  <eos>   one cannot wonder , one cannot wonder .  <eos>   " i am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but i assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere , i am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming .  <eos>   a fine place , but very retired ."  <eos>   my acquaintance with him has been but trifling .-- and even if i have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well .-- with such a woman he has a chance .-- i have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , i shall certainly wish him well ."  <eos>   thank you , my mother is remarkably well .  <eos>   she was his object , and every body must perceive it .  <eos>   while i , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless ?-- had we been met walking together between donwell and highbury , the truth must have been suspected .-- i was mad enough , however , to resent .-- i doubted her affection .  <eos>   i have been walking all this way in complete suspense .  <eos>   if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child , i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like .  <eos>   his good - nature , his humanity , as i tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses .  <eos>   she continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind .  <eos>   i could not stay two minutes .  <eos>   emma ' s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law ' s breaking out .  <eos>   i have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal ."  <eos>   do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye -- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ?"  <eos>   he had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs ; had heard voices , mirth continually ; thought they must be a most delightful set of people , longed to be with them , but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself .  <eos>   making - up indeed would not do .  <eos>   the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room .  <eos>   he found he could not be useful , and his feelings were too much irritated for talking .  <eos>   " it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer -- but it seems a case of necessity .  <eos>   at last , with some hesitation , harriet said --  <eos>   he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , i believe , considers me as one of his best friends .  <eos>   miss bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick .  <eos>   two such she did not want .  <eos>   " emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others ," rejoined mr . woodhouse , understanding but in part .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   " well , there _is_ feeling here .-- he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill .-- certainly , i can have no doubt of his being fond of her .  <eos>   " you will not find either , between donwell and highbury .  <eos>   one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland .  <eos>   that will just do for me , you know .  <eos>   " no , indeed , i have no doubts at all on that head .  <eos>   to amuse her , and be agreeable in her eyes , seemed all that he cared for -- and emma , glad to be enlivened , not sorry to be flattered , was gay and easy too , and gave him all the friendly encouragement , the admission to be gallant , which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance ; but which now , in her own estimation , meant nothing , though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very well describe .  <eos>   but i believe i am nice ; i do not like strange voices ; and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor .  <eos>   she endeavoured to be composed , and to be just .  <eos>   mr . weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation .  <eos>   " you are extremely kind ," said jane ; " but i cannot give up my early walk .  <eos>   charles , anne , must not it ?  <eos>   i shall think you a great blockhead , frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece ."  <eos>   miss smith , pray take care .  <eos>   " that is what you have in your head , i know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by ."  <eos>   she was so wretched and so vehement , complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of anne ; anne , who was nothing to louisa , while she was her sister , and had the best right to stay in henrietta ' s stead !  <eos>   the distressing explanation she had to make to harriet , and all that poor harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully .  <eos>   i did not know that i had fixed a day , but as he says i did , i am going now ."  <eos>   and , by what i understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   no !  <eos>   she could do justice to the superiority of lady russell ' s motives in this , over those of her father and elizabeth ; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness ; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung ; and in the event of admiral croft ' s really taking kellynch hall , she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her , of the past being known to those three only among her connexions , by whom no syllable , she believed , would ever be whispered , and in the trust that among his , the brother only with whom he had been residing , had received any information of their short - lived engagement .  <eos>   mrs . elton left them no choice .  <eos>   such personal praise might have struck her , especially as it did not appear to anne that the freckles were at all lessened .  <eos>   " mr . elton going to be married !"  <eos>   her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible .  <eos>   your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls .  <eos>   i like them extremely .  <eos>   when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs . weston , she found herself abruptly addressed with ,  <eos>   i doubted it more the next day on box hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to miss w ., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me .-- in short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and i returned the same evening to richmond , though i might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because i would be as angry with her as possible .  <eos>   " she should always send for perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment .  <eos>   emma listened , and then coolly said , " i shall not be satisfied , unless he comes ."  <eos>   we talked it all over with mr . weston last night .  <eos>   frank churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs . weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax , followed mr . cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .  <eos>   it was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by randalls .  <eos>   one man ' s ways may be as good as another ' s , but we all like our own best .  <eos>   it is natural , and it is honourable .-- yes , honourable , i think , to chuse so well and so gratefully .-- but that it will be a fortunate preference is more that i can promise .  <eos>   " when i got to donwell ," said he , " knightley could not be found .  <eos>   another minute brought another addition .  <eos>   in the course of a second visit she talked with great openness , and anne ' s astonishment increased .  <eos>   " nay , i had it from you .  <eos>   beyond it she would on no account proceed .  <eos>   " a very pretty trick you have been playing me , upon my word !  <eos>   miss woodhouse , i am quite concerned , i am sure you hit your foot .  <eos>   " ah !  <eos>   a miss hawkins -- that ' s all i know .  <eos>   two steps , jane , take care of the two steps .  <eos>   they could go there again with them in the autumn .  <eos>   he is an excellent young man , both as son and brother .  <eos>   " he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , sophy ," said the admiral ; " but there is no saying which .  <eos>   you may be very sure that if i had , i should have cautioned you accordingly ."  <eos>   " my advice ," said mrs . weston kindly and persuasively , " i certainly do feel tempted to give .  <eos>   don ' t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman ."  <eos>   the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread ; and mr . weston had his five minutes share of it ; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind .-- he saw the advantages of the match , and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife ; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing ; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it .  <eos>   lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , and woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .  <eos>   it was a right thing to do .  <eos>   i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way ."  <eos>   he is an excellent young man , both as son and brother .  <eos>   the musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school , bringing with them mrs harville ' s little children , to improve the noise of uppercross , and lessen that of lyme .  <eos>   " he is very young to settle ," was mr . woodhouse ' s observation .  <eos>   was the reply , and with a look of surprise .  <eos>   she had led her friend astray , and it would be a reproach to her for ever ; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings , and as strong as it had ever been before , in reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal and degrading .  <eos>   " that will do ," said he , when it was finished , thinking aloud -- " you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet ."  <eos>   she had left the instrument on the dancing being over , and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss musgroves an idea of .  <eos>   they must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt .  <eos>   " and i am sure , sir ."  <eos>   it is a most uncommon complexion , with her dark eye - lashes and hair -- a most distinguishing complexion !  <eos>   " i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before ."  <eos>   emma doubted the truth of this sentiment .  <eos>   yes -- mr . elton , i understand -- certainly as to dancing -- mrs . cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was -- mrs . cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , jane is so very great a favourite there .  <eos>   we had better leave the crofts to find their own level .  <eos>   i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with , who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece ."  <eos>   in frank ' s last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle ' s !  <eos>   i wish he could have such company oftener .  <eos>   if he would act in this sort of manner , on principle , consistently , regularly , their little minds would bend to his ."  <eos>   and we agreed it would be best to have the harp , for it seems to amuse her more than the piano - forte .  <eos>   yes , that will be quite enough for pleasure .  <eos>   nobody talked about it .  <eos>   and as it is some months since miss campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off ."  <eos>   she was not thoroughly comfortable herself .  <eos>   frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax ' s situation in life .  <eos>   if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman , i grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , i am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy .  <eos>   it is bad for him , i know , to be shut up as he is ; but what can we do ?  <eos>   " my father would say ` yes ,' mr . knightley ` no ;' and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium .  <eos>   this long meadow bordered a lane , which their footpath , at the end of it was to cross , and when the party had all reached the gate of exit , the carriage advancing in the same direction , which had been some time heard , was just coming up , and proved to be admiral croft ' s gig .  <eos>   " oh !  <eos>   she longed to see the crofts ; but when the meeting took place , it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them .  <eos>   miss bates should never again -- no , never !  <eos>   " it would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ?"  <eos>   " perfectly , perfectly right , my dearest harriet ; you are doing just what you ought .  <eos>   " nothing very bad .-- the fate of thousands .  <eos>   i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me , as to that .  <eos>   when they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully !-- he seemed to want to be acquainted with her .  <eos>   harriet looked grave .  <eos>   to talk would be only to irritate .-- she wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday .-- harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful .  <eos>   she cried , satisfied to have no one preferred to herself .--" you are a humourist , and may say what you like .  <eos>   i made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl -- mrs . dixon ' s wedding - present .-- so kind of her to think of my mother !  <eos>   we told you about the laundry - door , at uppercross .  <eos>   there was no end of miss elliot ' s charms ."  <eos>   i am always watching her to admire ; and i do pity her from my heart ."  <eos>   she had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it .  <eos>   in a low , cautious voice , he said : --  <eos>   the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room .  <eos>   she had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause .  <eos>   to restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up -- her hand seized -- her attention demanded , and mr . elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping -- fearing -- adoring -- ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .  <eos>   he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late .  <eos>   the good bateses -- i am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters .  <eos>   they must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt .  <eos>   she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character .  <eos>   let no name ever pass our lips .  <eos>   such a debasement on his !  <eos>   " he had been so fortunate as to -- i forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them .  <eos>   " have you indeed , sir ?-- bless me !  <eos>   dick had been left ill at gibraltar , with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth ."  <eos>   it was a very extraordinary thing !  <eos>   a circumstance rather unlucky occurred .  <eos>   " nonsense !  <eos>   " that may be done without horses .  <eos>   " when did that happen ?"  <eos>   there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction , and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow .  <eos>   however , i do really think mr . martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but as to leaving you , it is what i would not do upon any consideration ."  <eos>   " yes -- i have some right to that knowledge ; though i have never been at the place in my life .-- she is an odd woman !-- but i never allow myself to speak ill of her , on frank ' s account ; for i do believe her to be very fond of him .  <eos>   but in time they will .  <eos>   this could not be pardoned .  <eos>   she was actually forced to exert herself to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her .  <eos>   one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance .  <eos>   as soon as she could , she went after mary , and having found , and walked back with her to their former station , by the stile , felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected , and once more in motion together .  <eos>   i bring a new proposal on the subject :-- a thought of my father ' s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon .  <eos>   poor mr . woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming , and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride .-- could he have seen the heart , he would have cared very little for the lungs ; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil , without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either , he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr . perry , and talked on with much self - contentment , totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return .  <eos>   the crofts will associate with them ."  <eos>   " miss woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- i have something that i should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over ."  <eos>   " it is not now worth a regret ," said emma .  <eos>   " no , not true on your side .  <eos>   i like her the better for it .  <eos>   let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour .  <eos>   emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles .  <eos>   i have no idea of that sort of thing .  <eos>   you will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , i am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue ."  <eos>   he told me it was to be a great secret ; and , therefore , i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you , but he said you knew it ."  <eos>   anne could only feel that charles hayter was wise .  <eos>   although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , mr . and mrs . weston ' s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune .  <eos>   knightley .-- they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield , to allow them the fortnight ' s absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan .-- john and isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it .  <eos>   her person was rather good ; her face not unpretty ; but neither feature , nor air , nor voice , nor manner , were elegant .  <eos>   strangers filling their place !"  <eos>   there had been three alternatives , london , bath , or another house in the country .  <eos>   he was brilliant , he was headstrong .  <eos>   " yes , indeed , a very good letter ," replied emma rather slowly --" so good a letter , harriet , that every thing considered , i think one of his sisters must have helped him .  <eos>   serle understands boiling an egg better than any body .  <eos>   the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ;
